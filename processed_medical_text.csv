25,"Covering the entire heart is a saclike membrane called the pericardium,which has two layers: a visceral layer that s in contact with the heart and aparietal, or outer, layer. To prevent irritation when the heart moves againstthis layer during contraction, fluid lubricates the parietal pericardium.The heart has four chambers: two thin-walled chambers called atria andtwo thick-walled chambers called ventricles. The atria serve as reservoirsduring ventricular contraction (systole) and as booster pumps duringventricular relaxation (diastole). The left ventricle propels blood through thesystemic circulation. The right ventricle, which forces blood through thepulmonary circulation, is much thinner than the left because it meets only onesixth the resistance.a ELDER TIP As a persons body ages, the ventricular and aortic wallsstiffen, decreasing the heart s pumping action.HEART VALVESTwo kinds of valves work inside the heart: atrioventricular (atrioventricular) andsemilunar. The atrioventricular valve between the right atrium and the ventricle has threeleaflets, or cusps, and three papillary muscles; hence, it s called thetricuspid valve. The atrioventricular valve between the left atrium and the ventricleconsists of two cusps shaped like a bishop s hat, or miter, and two papillarymuscles and is called the mitral valve. The tricuspid and mitral valvesprevent blood backflow from the ventricles to the atria during ventricularcontraction. The leaflets of both valves are attached to the ventricles papillary muscles by thin, fibrous bands called chordae tendineae; theleaflets separate and descend funnel-like into the ventricles during diastoleand are pushed upward and together during systole to occlude the mitral andtricuspid orifices. The valves action isn t entirely passive because papillarymuscles contract during systole and prevent the leaflets from prolapsing intothe atria during ventricular contraction.The two semilunar valves, which resemble half-moons, prevent bloodbackflow from the aorta and pulmonary arteries into the ventricles whenthose chambers relax and fill with blood from the atria. They re referred toas the aortic valve and pulmonic valve for their respective arteries.a ELDER TIP In elderly people, fibrotic and sclerotic changes thickenheart valves and reduce their flexibility. These changes lead torigidity and incomplete closure of the valves, which may result in systolicor diastolic murmurs.",12,116
26,"THE CARDIAC CYCLEDiastole is the phase of ventricular relaxation and filling. As diastole begins,ventricular pressure falls below arterial pressure, and the aortic andpulmonic valves close. As ventricular pressure continues to fall below atrialpressure, the mitral and tricuspid valves open, and blood flows rapidly intothe ventricles. Atrial contraction then increases the volume of ventricularfilling by pumping 15 to 25 more blood into the ventricles. When systolebegins, the ventricular muscle contracts, raising ventricular pressure aboveatrial pressure and closing the mitral and tricuspid valves. When ventricularpressure finally becomes greater than that in the aorta and pulmonary artery,the aortic and pulmonic valves open, and the ventricles eject blood.Ventricular pressure continues to rise as blood is expelled from the heart. Assystole ends, the ventricles relax and stop ejecting blood, and ventricularpressure falls, closing both valves.S, (the first heart sound) is heard as the ventricles contract and the AVvalves close. S, is loudest at the heart s apex, over the mitral area. S, (thesecond heart sound), which is normally rapid and sharp, occurs when theaortic and pulmonic valves close. S, is loudest at the heart s base (secondintercostal space intercostal space on both sides of the stemum).Ventricular distention during diastole, which can occur in systolic heartfailure, creates low-frequency vibrations that may be heard as a third heartsound (S,), or ventricular gallop. An atrial gallop (S,) may appear at the endof diastole, just before S,, if atrial filling is forced into a ventricle that hasbecome less compliant or overdistended or has a decreased ability tocontract. A pressure rise and ventricular vibrations cause this sound.CARDIAC CONDUCTIONThe heart s conduction system is composed of specialized cells capable ofgenerating and conducting rhythmic electrical impulses to stimulate heartcontraction. This system includes the sinoatrial (sinoatrial) node, the atrioventricular junction,the bundle of His and its bundle branches, and the ventricular conductiontissue and Purkinje fibers.Normally, the sinoatrial node controls the heart rate and rhythm at 60 to 100beats/minute. Because the sinoatrial node has the lowest resting potential, it s theheart s pacemaker. If it defaults, another part of the system takes over. The atrioventricular junction may emerge at 40 to 60 beats/minute; the bundle of His and",16,111
27,"bundle branches at 30 to 40 beats/minute; and ventricular conduction tissue at20 to 30 beats/minute.a ELDER TIP As the myocardium of the aging heart becomes moreirritable, extrasystoles may occur along with sinus arrhythmias andsinus bradycardias. In addition, increased fibrous tissue infiltrates the SAnodes and intemodal atrial tracts, which may cause atrial fibrillationand flutter.CARDIAC OUTPUTCardiac output the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle into theaorta each minute is calculated by multiplying the stroke volume (theamount of blood the left ventricle ejects during each contraction) by the heartrate (number of beats/minute). When cellular demands increase, strokevolume or heart rate must increase.Many factors affect the heart rate, including exercise, pregnancy, andstress. When the sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, theheart rate increases; when the parasympathetic system releases acetylcholine,it slows. As a person ages, the heart rate takes longer to normalize afterexercise.Stroke volume depends on the ventricular blood volume and pressure atthe end of diastole (preload), resistance to ejection (afterload), and themyocardium s contractile strength (inotropy). Changes in preload, afterload,or inotropic state can alter the stroke volume.a ELDER TIP Exercise cardiac output declines slightly with age. Adecrease in maximum heart rate and contractility may cause thischange.CIRCULATION AND PULSESBlood circulates through three types of vessels: arteries, veins, andcapillaries. The sturdy, pliable walls of the arteries adjust to the volume ofblood leaving the heart. The major artery branching out of the left ventricle isthe aorta. Its segments and subbranches ultimately divide into minute, thin-walled (one-cell thick) capillaries. Capillaries pass the blood to the veins,which retum it to the heart. In the veins, valves prevent blood backflow.Cyrene TIP Aging contributes to arterial and venous insufficiency asthe strength and elasticity of blood vessels decrease.",12,115
28,"Pulses are felt best wherever an artery runs near the skin and over a hardstructure. (See Pulse points.) Easily found pulses are:Pulse Points Peripheral pulse rhythm should correspond exactly to the auscultatoryheart rhythm. The pulse s character may offer useful information. Forexample, pulsus altemans, a strong beat followed by a weak one, canmean myocardial weakness. A water-hammer (or Corrigan) pulse, aforceful bounding pulse best felt in the carotid arteries or in the forearm,accompanies increased pulse pressure commonly with capillarypulsations of the fingemails (Quincke sign). This pulse usually indicatesaortic valve regurgitation.Pulsus bisferiens, a double peripheral pulse for every apical beat, cansignal aortic regurgitation or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.Pulsus bigeminus is a coupled rhythm; you feel its beat in pairs. Pulsusparadoxus is exaggerated waxing and waning of the arterial pressure(215 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration),often seen in cardiac tamponade.",8,47

Lymphatics alsoextract bacteria and foreign bodies.CARDIOVASCULAR ASSESSMENTPhysical assessment provides vital information about cardiovascular status. Check for underlying cardiovascular disorders, such as central cyanosis(impaired gas exchange), edema (heart failure or valvular disease), andclubbing (congenital cardiovascular disease). Palpate the peripheral pulses bilaterally and evaluate their rate, equality,and quality on a scale of 0 (absent) to 4 (bounding). (See Pulseamplitude scale.)Pulse amplitude scale To record your patient s pulse amplitude, use this standard scale: 0: Pulse isn t palpable. 1: Pulse is thready, weak, difficult to find, may fade in and out,and disappears easily with pressure. 2: Pulse is constant but not strong; light pressure must be appliedor pulse will disappear. 3: Pulse considered normal. Is easily palpable, doesn t disappearwith pressure. 4: Pulse is strong, bounding, and doesn t disappear with pressure.",11,65
31,"Inspect the carotid arteries for equal appearance. Auscultate for bruits;then palpate the arteries individually, one side at a time, for thrills (finevibrations due to irregular blood flow). Check for pulsations in the jugular veins (more easily seen than felt).Watch for jugular vein distention (JVD) a possible sign of right-sidedheart failure, valvular stenosis, cardiac tamponade, or pulmonaryembolism. Take blood pressure readings in both arms while the patient islying, sitting, and standing. Palpate the precordium for any abnormal pulsations, such as lifts, heaves,or thrills. Use the palms (at the base of the fingertips) or the fingertips.The normal apex will be felt as a light tap and extends over 1 (2.5 cm) orless. Systematically auscultate the anterior chest wall for each of the four heartsounds in the aortic area (second intercostal space at the right stemal border),pulmonic area (second intercostal space at the left stemal border), right ventriculararea (lower half of the left stemal border), and mitral area (fifth intercostal space at themidclavicular line). However, don t limit your auscultation to these fourareas. Valvular sounds may be heard all over the precordium. Therefore,inch your stethoscope in a Z pattem, from the base of the heart across anddown and then over to the apex, or start at the apex and work your way up.For low-pitched sounds, use the bell of the stethoscope; for high-pitchedsounds, the diaphragm. Carefully inspect each area for pulsations, andpalpate for thrills. Check the location of apical pulsation for deviations innormal size (7/, to /, 1 to 2 cm ) and position (in the mitral area) possible signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, left-sided valvular disease,or right ventricular disease.Listen for the vibrating sound of turbulent blood flow through a stenotic orincompetent valve. Time the murmur to determine where it occurs in thecardiac cycle between S, and S, (systolic), between S, and thefollowing S, (diastolic), or throughout systole (holosystolic). Finally,listen for the scratching or squeaking of a pericardial friction rub. SPECIAL CARDIOVASCULAR TESTSElectrocardiography (ECG) measures electrical activity by recordingcurrents transmitted by the heart. It can detect ischemia, injury, necrosis,",16,107
32,"bundle branch blocks, fascicular blocks, conduction delay, chamberenlargement, and arrhythmias. In Holter monitoring, a tape recording tracksas many as 100,000 cardiac cycles over a 12- or 24-hour period. This testmay be used to assess the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs or to evaluatearrhythmia symptoms. A signal-averaged ECG will identify afterpotentials,which are associated with a risk of ventricular arrhythmias. (See Positioningchest electrodes, page 5.)Positioning chest electrodes To record the 12-lead electrocardiogram, place electrodes on thepatient s arms and legs (with the ground lead on the patient s right leg).The three standard limb leads (I, I, II) and the three augmented leads(a V,, a V,, a V,) are recorded using these electrodes.To record the precordial (chest) leads, place the electrodes asfollows: V, fourth intercostal space, right stemal border V, fourth intercostal space, left stemal border V, midway between V, and V, V, fifth intercostal space, left midclavicular line V. fifth intercostal space, left anterior axillary line V. fifth intercostal space, left midaxillary line",6,50
33,"Chest X-rays may reveal cardiac enlargement and aortic dilation. Theyalso assess pulmonary circulation. When pulmonary venous and arterialpressures rise, characteristic changes appear, such as dilation of thepulmonary venous shadows. When pulmonary venous pressure exceedsoncotic pressure of the blood, capillary fluid leaks into lung tissues, causingpulmonary edema. This fluid may settle in the alveoli, producing a butterflypattem, or the lungs may appear cloudy or hazy; in the interlobular septa,sharp linear densities (Kerley lines) may appear.Exercise testing intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) treadmill determinesthe heart s response to physical stress. This test measures blood pressure and ECG changes during increasingly rigorous exercises. Myocardial ischemia,abnormal blood pressure response, or arrhythmias indicate the circulatorysystem s failure to adapt to exercise.Cardiac catheterization evaluates chest pain, the need for coronary arterysurgery or angioplasty, congenital heart defects, and valvular heart diseaseand determines the extent of heart failure. Right-sided catheterizationinvolves threading a pulmonary artery thermodilution catheter, which canmeasure cardiac output, through a vein into the right side of the heart,pulmonary artery, and its branches in the lungs to measure right atrial, right",8,63
34,"ventricular, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary artery wedge pressures(PAWPs). Left-sided catheterization entails retrograde catheterization of theleft ventricle or transseptal catheterization of the left atrium Ventriculography during left-sided catheterization involves injectingradiopaque dye into the left ventricle to measure ejection fraction and todisclose abnormal heart wall motion or mitral valve incompetence.In coronary angiography, radiopaque material injected into coronaryarteries allows cineangiographic visualization of coronary arterial narrowingor occlusion.Echocardiography uses echoes from pulsed high-frequency sound waves(ultrasound) to evaluate cardiac _ structures. Two-dimensionalechocardiography (most common), in which an ultrasound beam rapidlysweeps through an arc, produces a cross-sectional or fan-shaped view ofcardiac structures. Contrast agents may be used for image enhancement.Doppler echocardiography records blood flow within the cardiovascularsystem. Color Doppler echocardiography shows the direction of blood flow,which provides information about the degree of valvular insufficiency.Transesophageal echocardiography combines ultrasound with endoscopy tobetter view the heart s structures. This procedure allows images to be takenfrom the heart s posterior aspect.Echocardiography provides information about valve leaflets, size anddimensions of heart chambers, and thickness and motion of the septum andthe ventricular walls. It can also reveal intracardiac masses, detectpericardial effusion, diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and estimatecardiac output and ejection fraction. This test can also evaluate possibleaortic dissection when it involves the ascending aorta.In multiple-gated acquisition scanning (MUGA), a radioactive isotope inthe intravascular compartment allows measurement of stroke volume, wallmotion, and ventricular ejection fraction. Myocardial imaging uses aradioactive isotope to detect abnormalities in myocardial perfusion. Thisagent concentrates in normally perfused areas of the myocardium but not inischemic areas ( cold spots ), which may be permanent (scar tissue) ortemporary (from transient ischemia). These tests can be done as exercisestudies or can be combined with drugs (nuclear stress test), in patients unableto exercise.Peripheral arteriography consists of a fluoroscopic X-ray after arterialinjection of a contrast medium. Similarly, phlebography defines the venous",12,107
35,"system after injection of a contrast medium into a vein.Doppler ultrasonography evaluates the peripheral vascular system andassesses peripheral artery disease (PAD) when combined with sequentialsystolic blood pressure readings.Endomyocardial biopsy can detect cardiomyopathy, infiltrative myocardialdiseases, and, most often, transplant rejection.Electrophysiologic studies help diagnose conduction system disease andserious arrhythmias. Electronic induction and termination of arrhythmias aiddrug selection. Endocardial mapping detects an arrhythmia s focus using afinger electrode. Epicardial mapping uses a computer and a devicecontaining electrodes that s slipped over the heart to detect arrhythmias.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can investigate cardiac structure andfunction. Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonancespectroscopy are used to assess myocardial metabolism.Electron-beam computed tomography, also known as ultrafast computedtomography, is used to detect microcalcifications in the coronary arteries andcan give a coronary calcium score. This test is useful for identifying earlycoronary artery disease (CAD).Blood tests Cardiac enzymes (cellular proteins released into blood after cell membraneinjury) confirm acute myocardial infarction (MI) or severe cardiac trauma.All cardiac enzymes creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase, andaspartate aminotransferase, for example are also found in other cells.Fractionation of enzymes can determine the source of damaged cells. Forexample, three fractions of CK are isolated, one of which (an isoenzymecalled CK-MB) is found only in cardiac cells. CK-MB in the blood indicatesinjury to myocardial cells.Measurement of a cardiac protein called troponin is the most precise wayto determine whether a patient has experienced an MI. Some 6 hours after an MI, a blood test can detect two forms of troponin: T and I. Troponin T levelspeak about 2 days after an MI and retum to normal about 16 days later.Troponin I levels reach their peak in less than 1 day after an MI and retum tonormal in about 7 days.MANAGING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE",9,98
36,"Patients with cardiovascular disease pose a tremendous challenge. Theirsheer numbers alone compel a thorough understanding of cardiovascularanatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Anticipate a high anxiety level incardiac patients, and provide support and reassurance, especially duringprocedures such as cardiac catheterization.Cardiac rehabilitation programs are widely prescribed and offer educationand support along with exercise instruction. Rehabilitation programs begin inhealthcare facilities and continue on an outpatient basis. Helping the patientresume a satisfying lifestyle requires planning and comprehensive teaching.Inform the patient about healthcare facilities and organizations that offercardiac rehabilitation programs.Congenital Acyanotic Defects VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECTCauses and Incidence In ventricular septal defect (VSD), the most common congenital heartdisorder, an opening in the septum between the ventricles allows blood toshunt between the left and the right ventricles. This disease accounts for up to30 of all congenital heart defects. Although most children with congenitalheart defects are otherwise normal, in some, VSD coexists with additionalbirth defects, especially Down syndrome and other autosomal trisomies,renal anomalies, and such cardiac defects as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)and coarctation of the aorta. VSDs are located in the membranous ormuscular portion of the ventricular septum and vary in size. Some defectsclose spontaneously; in other defects, the entire septum is absent, creating asingle ventricle. The prognosis is good for defects that close spontaneouslyor are correctable surgically but poor for untreated defects, which aresometimes fatal by age 1, usually from secondary complications. Less than1 of neonates are bom with VSD. In 80 to 90 of neonates who are bomwith this disorder, the hole is small and will usually close spontaneously. Inthe remaining 10 to 20 of neonates, surgery is needed to close the hole.(See Understanding ventricular septal defect, page 7.)",14,92
37,"Understanding Ventricular Septal Defect A ventricular septal defect (VSD), the most common type of congenitaldisorder, is an abnormal opening between the right and left ventricles thatallows blood to shunt between them. Not always readily apparent atbirth, the defect can be small and may close spontaneously. The septummay be entirely absent, resulting in a single ventricle. A large, untreateddefect can cause right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension,and heart failure. VSD is classified as an increased pulmonary bloodflow defect.Aorta To right , To leftlung b lung Pulmonaryartery Left Vena .ventriclecava Right ventricle Ventricularseptal defect Pathophysiology",5,28
38,"In neonates with VSD, the ventricular septum fails to close completely by theeighth week of gestation, as it would normally.VSD isn t readily apparent at birth, because right and left ventricularpressures are about equal, so blood doesn t shunt through the defect. As thepulmonary vasculature gradually relaxes, 4 to 8 weeks after birth, rightventricular pressure decreases, allowing blood to shunt from the left to theright ventricle. In small or restrictive defects, right ventricle pressure is onlyslightly elevated, while pulmonary artery pressures (PAPs) and peripheralvascular resistance (PVR) remain normal. In moderate defects, the size of thedefect determines the magnitude of the shunt. When right ventricular pressuredecreases, the left atrium and ventricle may become fluid overloaded.Because large defects do not meet a lot of flow resistance, the pressure of theventricles is equal at first. As PVR decreases, volume increases to thepulmonary system, in tum increasing the volume of the left ventricle. This, intum, can create left ventricular dilation, followed by increased left atrialpressure and pulmonary venous pressure.Complications Right arterial and ventricular hypertrophy Heart failure Pulmonary hypertension Signs and Symptoms Clinical features of VSD vary with the defect s size, the shunting s effect onthe pulmonary vasculature, and the infant s age. In a small VSD, shunting isminimal, and PAP and heart size remain normal. Such defects may eventuallyclose spontaneously without ever causing symptoms.Initially, large VSD shunts cause left atrial and left ventricularhypertrophy. Later, an uncorrected VSD will cause right ventricularhypertrophy due to increasing pulmonary vascular resistance. Eventually,biventricular heart failure and cyanosis (from reversal of shunt direction)occur. Resulting cardiac hypertrophy may make the anterior chest wallprominent. A large VSD increases the risk of pneumonia.Infants with large VSDs are thin and small and gain weight slowly. Theymay develop heart failure with dusky skin; liver, heart, and spleenenlargement because of systemic venous congestion; diaphoresis; feeding",14,115
39,"difficulties; rapid, grunting respirations; and increased heart rate. They mayalso develop severe pulmonary hypertension. Fixed pulmonary hypertensionmay occur much later in life with right-to-left shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome),causing cyanosis and clubbing of the nail beds.The typical murmur associated with a VSD is blowing or rumbling andvaries in frequency. In the neonate, a moderately loud early systolic murmurmay be heard along the lower left stemal border. About the second or thirdday after birth, the murmur may become louder and longer. In infants, themurmur may be loudest near the heart s base and may suggest pulmonarystenosis (PS). A small VSD may produce a functional murmur or acharacteristic loud, harsh systolic murmur. Larger VSDs produce audiblemurmurs (at least a grade 3 pansystolic), loudest at the fourth intercostal space, usuallywith a thrill; however, a large VSD with minimal pressure gradient may haveno audible murmur. In addition, the pulmonic component of S, sounds loudand is widely split. Palpation reveals displacement of the point of maximalimpulse to the left. When fixed pulmonary hypertension is present, a diastolicmurmur may be audible on auscultation, the systolic murmur becomes quieter,and S, is greatly accentuated.Diagnosis Diagnostic findings include: Chest X-ray is normal in small defects; in large VSDs, it showscardiomegaly, left atrial and left ventricular enlargement, and prominentpulmonary vascular markings.ECG is normal in children with small VSDs; in large VSDs, it shows leftand right ventricular hypertrophy, suggesting pulmonary hypertension.Echocardiography may detect a large VSD and its location in the septum,estimate the size of a left-to-right shunt, suggest pulmonary hypertension,and identify associated lesions and complications.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Cardiac catheterization determines the VSD ssize and exact location, calculates the degree of shunting bycomparing the blood oxygen saturation in each ventricle, determines theextent of pulmonary hypertension, and detects associated defects.Treatment",11,103
40,"In mild cases, no treatment is needed, although the infant should be closelyfollowed to make sure that the hole closes properly as the infant grows.Large defects usually require early surgical correction before heart failureand irreversible pulmonary vascular disease develop.For small defects, surgery consists of simple suture closure. Moderate tolarge defects require insertion of a patch graft, using cardiopulmonarybypass. In patients with heart failure, digoxin and diuretics may beprescribed to control symptoms. In patients who develop increasedpulmonary resistance and irreversible pulmonary vascular changes thatproduce a reversible right-to-left shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome), a heart lung transplant may be required.If the child has other defects and will benefit from delaying surgery,pulmonary artery banding normalizes pressures and flow distal to the bandand prevents pulmonary vascular disease, allowing postponement of surgery.(Pulmonary artery banding is done only when the child has othercomplications.) A rare complication of VSD repair is complete heart blockfrom interference with the bundle of His during surgery. (Heart block mayrequire temporary or permanent pacemaker implantation.)Before surgery, treatment consists of: digoxin, sodium restriction, and diuretics to prevent heart failure careful monitoring by physical examination, X-ray, and ECG to detectincreased pulmonary hypertension, which indicates a need for earlysurgerymeasures to prevent infection (prophylactic antibiotics, e.g., to preventinfective endocarditis)Generally, postoperative treatment includes a brief period of mechanicalventilation. The patient will need analgesics and may also require diureticsto increase urine output, continuous infusions of nitroprusside or adrenergicagents to regulate blood pressure and cardiac output and, in rare cases, atemporary pacemaker.Special Considerations Although the parents of an infant with VSD often suspect something is wrongwith their child before diagnosis, they need psychological support to helpthem accept the reality of a serious cardiac disorder. Because surgery maytake place months after diagnosis, parent teaching is vital to prevent",10,106
41,"complications until the child is scheduled for surgery or the defect closes.Thorough explanations of all tests are also essential. Instruct parents to watch for signs of heart failure, such as poor feeding,sweating, and heavy breathing. If the child is receiving digoxin or other medications, tell the parents howto give it and how to recognize adverse effects. Caution them to keepmedications out of the reach of all children. Teach parents to recognize and report early signs of infection and to avoidexposing the child to people with obvious infections. Encourage parents to let the child engage in normal activities. Tell parents to follow up with their pediatrician. Also tell them that childlife therapy may be appropriate if their child displays delayed growth anddevelopment or failure to thrive. Stress the importance of prophylactic antibiotics before and after surgery.After surgery to correct VSD: Monitor vital signs and intake and output. Maintain the infant s bodytemperature with an overbed warmer. Give catecholamines, nitroprusside,and diuretics, as ordered; analgesics as needed. Monitor central venous pressure (CVP), intra-arterial blood pressure, andleft atrial or PAP readings. Assess heart rate and rhythm for signs ofconduction block.Check oxygenation, particularly in a child who requires mechanicalventilation. Suction to maintain a patent airway and to prevent atelectasisand pneumonia, as needed.Monitor pacemaker effectiveness if needed. Watch for signs of failure,such as bradycardia and hypotension. Reassure parents and allow them to participate in their child s care.ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECTCauses and Incidence In an atrial septal defect (ASD), an opening between the left and the rightatria allows shunting of blood between the chambers. Ostium secundumdefect (most common) occurs in the region of the fossa ovalis andoccasionally extends inferiorly, close to the vena cava; sinus venosus defectoccurs in the superior posterior portion of the atrial septum, sometimes",17,104
42,"extending into the vena cava, and is almost always associated with abnormaldrainage of pulmonary veins into the right atrium; ostium primum defectoccurs in the inferior portion of the septum primum and is usually associatedwith atrioventricular valve abnormalities (cleft mitral valve) and conduction defects. Thecause of ASD is unknown.ASD accounts for about 6 to 8 of congenital heart defects and appearsalmost twice as often in females as in males, with a strong familial tendency.Although ASD is usually a benign defect during infancy and childhood,delayed development of symptoms and complications makes it one of themost common congenital heart defects diagnosed in adults. ASD is present in4 of every 100,000 people. Symptoms usually develop before age 30. Whenno other congenital defect exists, the patient especially if a child may beasymptomatic. The prognosis is excellent in asymptomatic patients but poorin those with cyanosis caused by large, untreated defects. (See Understanding atrial septal defect.)Understanding Atrial Septal Defect An atrial septal defect (ASD) is an abnormal opening between the leftand the right atria. A small opening may cause few symptoms. However,if the opening is large, higher pressure in the left atrium can shunt largeamounts of blood into the right atrium, which can result in right heartvolume overload, right atrial and ventricular enlargement, and pulmonaryhypertension. ASD is classified as an increased pulmonary blood flowdefect and is one of the most common congenital heart defects.",11,70
43,"Atrial septaldefect Aorta Pulmonaryartery Left Right atriumatrium Pathophysiology In this condition, blood shunts from left to right because left atrial pressurenormally is slightly higher than right atrial pressure; this pressure differenceforces large amounts of blood through a defect. The left-to-right shunt resultsin right heart volume overload, affecting the right atrium, right ventricle, andpulmonary arteries. Eventually, the right atrium enlarges, and the rightventricle dilates to accommodate the increased blood volume. If pulmonaryartery hypertension develops because of the shunt (rare in children),increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular hypertrophywill follow. In some adult patients, irreversible (fixed) pulmonary arteryhypertension causes reversal of the shunt direction, which results inunoxygenated blood entering the systemic circulation, causing cyanosis.",5,35
44,"Complications Unoxygenated blood in systemic circulation Right and left ventricular hypertrophy Atrial arrhythmias Heart failure Emboli Signs and Symptoms ASD commonly goes undetected in preschoolers; such children maycomplain about feeling tired only after extreme exertion and may havefrequent respiratory tract infections but otherwise appear normal and healthy.However, children with large shunts may show growth retardation. Childrenwith ASD seldom develop heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, infectiveendocarditis, or other complications. However, as adults, they usuallymanifest pronounced symptoms, such as fatigability and dyspnea on exertion,frequently to the point of severe limitation of activity (especially after age40).In children, auscultation reveals an early to midsystolic murmur,superficial in quality, heard at the second or third left intercostal space. In patients withlarge shunts (resulting from increased tricuspid valve flow), a low-pitcheddiastolic murmur is heard at the lower left stemal border, which becomesmore pronounced on inspiration. Although the murmur s intensity is a roughindicator of the size of the left-to-right shunt, its low pitch sometimes makesit difficult to hear and, if the pressure gradient is relatively low, a murmurmay not be detectable. Other signs include a fixed, widely split S,, caused bydelayed closure of the pulmonic valve, and a systolic click or late systolicmurmur at the apex, resulting from mitral valve prolapse (MVP), whichoccasionally affects older children with ASD.In older patients with large, uncorrected defects and fixed pulmonaryartery hypertension, auscultation reveals an accentuated S,. A pulmonaryejection click and an audible S, may also be present. Clubbing and cyanosisbecome evident; syncope and hemoptysis may occur with severe pulmonaryvascular disease.Diagnosis",8,90
45,"A history of increasing fatigue and characteristic physical features suggest ASD. The following findings confirm it:Chest X-ray shows an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle, aprominent pulmonary artery, and increased pulmonary vascular markings. ECG may be normal but usually shows right axis deviation, prolonged PRinterval, varying degrees of right bundle branch block, right ventricularhypertrophy, atrial fibrillation (particularly in severe cases after age 30)and, in ostium primum defect, left axis deviation. Echocardiography measures right ventricular enlargement, may locate thedefect, and shows volume overload in the right side of the heart. (Othercauses of right ventricular enlargement must be ruled out.)CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Two-dimensional echocardiography with color Doppler flow, contrast echocardiography, or both have supplantedcardiac catheterization as the confirming tests for ASD. Cardiaccatheterization is used if inconsistencies exist in the clinical data or ifsignificant pulmonary hypertension is suspected.Treatment Operative repair is advised for all patients with uncomplicated ASD withevidence of significant left-to-right shunting. Ideally, this is performed whenthe patient is between ages 2 and 4. Operative treatment shouldn t beperformed in patients with small defects and trivial left-to-right shunts.Because ASD seldom produces complications in infants and toddlers,surgery can be delayed until they reach preschool or early school age. Alarge defect may need immediate surgical closure with sutures or a patchgraft.Physicians have developed a new procedure, referred to as catheterclosure or transcatheter closure of the ASD, that uses wires or catheters toclose ASD without surgery. In this procedure, the surgeon makes a tinyincision in the groin to introduce the catheters, then advances the cathetersinto the heart, and places the closure device across the ASD. This proceduremay not be applicable to all patients.Special Considerations",12,97
46,"Before cardiac catheterization, explain pretest and posttest procedures tothe child and her parents. If possible, use drawings or other visual aids toexplain it to the child. As needed, teach the patient about prophylactic antibiotics to preventinfective endocarditis. (They may be administered before dental or otherinvasive procedures.) Ifsurgery is scheduled, teach the child and his or her parents about theintensive care unit (ICU) and introduce them to the staff. Show parentswhere they can wait during the operation. Explain postoperativeprocedures, tubes, dressings, and monitoring equipment. After surgery, closely monitor the patient s vital signs, central venous andintra-arterial pressures, and intake and output. Watch for atrialarrhythmias, which may remain uncorrected.COARCTATION OF THE AORTACauses and Incidence Coarctation is a narrowing of the aorta, usually just below the left subclavianartery, near the site where the ligamentum arteriosum (the remnant of theductus arteriosus, a fetal blood vessel) joins the pulmonary artery to theaorta. Coarctation may occur with aortic valve stenosis (usually of abicuspid aortic valve) and with severe cases of hypoplasia of the aortic arch,PDA, and VSD. This is typically sporadic and without clear cause beforethis condition induces severe systemic hypertension or degenerative changesin the aorta. (See Understanding coarctation of the aorta.)Understanding Coarctation of the Aorta Coarctation is a narrowing of the aorta, usually just below the leftsubclavian artery, near the site where the ligamentum arteriosum joins thepulmonary artery to the aorta. It can result from spasm and constriction ofthe smooth muscle in the ductus arteriosus as it closes. Restricted bloodflow through the narrow aorta increases the pressure load on the leftventricle, resulting in dilation of the proximal aorta, left ventricularhypertrophy, elevated upper body blood pressures, and diminished bloodflow to the lower body. The ductus arteriosus may be open or closed.",16,95
47,"Coarctation of the aorta is more common in boys and is the leading causeof heart failure in the first few months of life. It s classified as anobstruction to blood flow leaving the heart.Aorta Normallyclosed Coarctationductus . of aortaarteriosus Pulmonaryartery Coarctation of the aorta occurs in 4 of every 10,000 people bom each yearin the United States and is usually diagnosed in children or adults youngerthan age 40. It accounts for about 4 to 6 of all congenital heart defects inchildren and is twice as common in males as in females. When it occurs infemales, it s commonly associated with Tumer syndrome, a chromosomaldisorder that causes ovarian dysgenesis. Generally, the prognosis forcoarctation of the aorta depends on the severity of associated cardiacanomalies; the prognosis for isolated coarctation is good if correctivesurgery is performed.",6,41
48,"Pathophysiology Coarctation of the aorta may develop as a result of spasm and constriction ofthe smooth muscle in the ductus arteriosus as it closes. Possibly, thiscontractile tissue extends into the aortic wall, causing narrowing. Theobstructive process causes hypertension in the aortic branches above theconstriction (arteries that supply the arms, neck, and head) and diminishedpressure in the vessels below the constriction.Restricted blood flow through the narrowed aorta increases the pressureload on the left ventricle and causes dilation of the proximal aorta andventricular hypertrophy. Untreated, this condition may lead to left-sided heartfailure and, rarely, to cerebral hemorrhage and aortic rupture. If VSDaccompanies coarctation, blood shunts left to right, straining the right side ofthe heart. This leads to pulmonary hypertension and, eventually, right-sidedheart hypertrophy and failure.Complications Infective endocarditis Pulmonary hypertension Right ventricular hypertrophy Right-sided heart failure Signs and Symptoms Clinical features vary with age. During the first year of life, when aorticcoarctation may cause heart failure, the infant displays tachypnea, dyspnea,pulmonary edema, pallor, tachycardia, failure to thrive, cardiomegaly, andhepatomegaly. In most cases, heart sounds are normal unless a coexistingcardiac defect is present. Femoral pulses are absent or diminished.If coarctation is asymptomatic in infancy, it usually remains so throughoutadolescence, as collateral circulation develops to bypass the narrowedsegment. During adolescence, this defect may produce dyspnea, claudication,headaches, epistaxis, and hypertension in the upper extremities despitecollateral circulation. It commonly causes resting systolic hypertension andwide pulse pressure; high diastolic pressure readings are the same in both thearms and the legs. Coarctation may also produce a visible aortic pulsation inthe suprastemal notch, a continuous systolic murmur, an accentuated S,, andan S,.",12,96
49,"Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS The cardinal signs of coarctation of the aortaare resting systolic hypertension, absent or diminished femoral pulses,and wide pulse pressure.The following tests support this diagnosis:Chest X-ray may demonstrate left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, awide ascending and descending aorta, and notching of the undersurfacesof the ribs, due to extensive collateral circulation.ECG may eventually reveal left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography may show increased left ventricular muscle thickness,coexisting aortic valve abnormalities, and the coarctation site. Doppler ultrasound and cardiac catheterization evaluate collateralcirculation and measure pressure in the right and left ventricles and in theascending and descending aortas (on both sides of the obstruction).MRI enables assessment of the anatomy and function of aorticabnormalities.Treatment For an infant with heart failure caused by coarctation of the aorta, treatmentconsists of medical management with digoxin, diuretics, oxygen, andsedatives. If medical management fails, surgery may be needed.The child s condition usually determines the timing of surgery. Signs ofheart failure or hypertension may call for early surgery. If these signs don tappear, surgery usually occurs during the preschool years.Before the operation, the child may require endocarditis prophylaxis or, ifhe or she is older and has previously undetected coarctation,antihypertensive therapy. During surgery, the surgeon uses a flap of the leftsubclavian artery to reconstruct an unobstructed aorta.Balloon angioplasty with possible stent placement may also be indicatedfor some patients as an altemative to surgical repair. It uses a techniquesimilar to that used to open the coronary arteries, but is performed on theaorta.Special considerations",8,91
50,"Palpate the pulses in the legs in newboms and at well-baby visits todetect absent or diminished pulses. When coarctation in an infant requires rapid digitalization, monitor vitalsigns closely and watch for digoxin toxicity (poor feeding and vomiting). Balance intake and output carefully, especially if the infant is receivingdiuretics with fluid restriction. Because the infant may not be able to maintain proper body temperature,regulate environmental temperature with an overbed warmer if needed.Monitor blood glucose levels to detect possible hypoglycemia, which mayoccur as glycogen stores become depleted. Offer the parents emotional support and an explanation of the disorder.Also explain diagnostic procedures, surgery, and drug therapy. Tellparents what to expect postoperatively. For an older child, assess the blood pressure in extremities regularly,explain any exercise restrictions, stress the need to take medicationsproperly and to watch for adverse effects, and teach about tests and otherprocedures.After corrective surgery: Monitor blood pressure closely, using an intra-arterial line. Measureblood pressure in arms and legs. Monitor intake and output.If the patient develops hypertension and requires a medication such asnitroprusside, administer it, as ordered, using an infusion pump. Watch forsevere hypotension and regulate the dosage carefully. Provide pain relief and encourage a gradual increase in activity.Promote adequate respiratory functioning through tuming, coughing, anddeep breathing. Watch for abdominal pain or rigidity and signs of gastrointestinal (GI) orurinary bleeding. Ifan older child needs to continue antihypertensives after surgery, teachthe patient and his parents about them. Stress the importance of continued endocarditis prophylaxis asappropriate.PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUSCauses and Incidence",14,97
51,"The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that connects the pulmonaryartery to the descending aorta. In PDA, the lumen of the ductus remains openafter birth. This creates a left-to-right shunt of blood from the aorta to thepulmonary artery and results in recirculation of arterial blood through thelungs. Normally, the ductus closes within days to weeks after birth. Failure toclose is most prevalent in premature neonates, probably as a result ofabnormalities in oxygenation or the relaxant action of prostaglandin E, whichprevents ductal spasm and contracture necessary for closure. However, mostof the time, the cause of this condition is unknown. PDA commonlyaccompanies rubella syndrome and may be associated with other congenitaldefects, such as coarctation of the aorta, VSD, and pulmonary and aorticstenoses.Initially, PDA may produce no clinical effects, but in time it canprecipitate pulmonary vascular disease, causing symptoms to appear by age40. PDA is found in 1 of every 2,000 infants and is the most commoncongenital heart defect found in adults. It affects twice as many females asmales. Additionally, babies bom at above 10,000 feet in altitude are moreaffected.The prognosis is good if the shunt is small or surgical repair is effective.Otherwise, PDA may advance to intractable heart failure, which may befatal. (See Understanding patent ductus arteriosus.)Understanding Patent Ductus Arteriosus The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that connects the pulmonaryartery to the descending aorta. Normally, the ductus closes within weeksafter birth. However, with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), it remainsopen, creating a left-to-right shunt of blood from the aorta to thepulmonary artery and resulting in recirculation of arterial blood throughthe lungs. PDA is classified as an increased pulmonary blood flowdefect.",15,85
52,"Aorta Patent ductusarteriosus Pulmonary artery Pathophysiology In PDA, relative resistances in pulmonary and systemic vasculature and thesize of the ductus determine the amount of left-to-right shunting. The leftatrium and left ventricle must accommodate the increased pulmonary venousretum, in tum increasing filling pressure and workload on the left side of theheart and possibly causing heart failure. In the final stages of untreated PDA,the left-to-right shunt leads to chronic pulmonary artery hypertension thatbecomes fixed and unreactive. This causes the shunt to reverse; unoxygenatedblood thus enters systemic circulation, causing cyanosis.Complications Left-sided heart failure Pulmonary artery hypertension",4,35
53,"Respiratory distress (children)Signs and Symptoms In neonates, especially those who are premature, a large PDA usuallyproduces respiratory distress, with signs of heart failure due to thetremendous volume of blood shunted to the lungs through a patent ductus andthe increased workload on the left side of the heart. Other characteristicfeatures may include heightened susceptibility to respiratory tract infections,slow motor development, and failure to thrive. Most children with PDA haveno symptoms except cardiac ones. Others may exhibit signs of heart disease,such as physical underdevelopment, fatigability, and frequent respiratorytract infections. Adults with undetected PDA may develop pulmonaryvascular disease and, by age 40, may display fatigability and dyspnea onexertion. About 10 of them also develop infective endocarditis.Auscultation reveals the classic machinery murmur (Gibson murmur): acontinuous murmur (during systole and diastole) best heard at the heart sbase, at the second left intercostal space under the left clavicle in 85 of children with PDA. This murmur may obscure S,. However, with a right-to-left shunt, sucha murmur may be absent. Palpation may reveal a thrill at the left stemalborder and a prominent left ventricular impulse. Peripheral arterial pulsesare bounding (Corrigan pulse); pulse pressure is widened because of anelevation in systolic blood pressure and, primarily, a drop in diastolicpressure.Diagnosis Chest X-ray may show increased pulmonary vascular markings, prominentpulmonary arteries, and left ventricle and aorta enlargement. ECG may be normal or may indicate left atrial or ventricular hypertrophyand, in pulmonary vascular disease, biventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis, detecting and helping toestimate the size of a PDA. It also reveals an enlarged left atrium and leftventricle or right ventricular hypertrophy from pulmonary vasculardisease.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Cardiac catheterization can also be performedand shows pulmonary arterial oxygen content higher than rightventricular content because of the influx of aortic blood. Increased PAP",14,101
54,"indicates a large shunt or, if it exceeds systemic arterial pressure, severepulmonary vascular disease. Catheterization allows calculation of bloodvolume crossing the ductus and can rule out associated cardiac defects.Dye injection definitively demonstrates PDA.Treatment Asymptomatic infants with PDA require no immediate treatment. Those withheart failure require fluid restriction, diuretics, and cardiac glycosides tominimize or control symptoms. If these measures can t control heart failure,surgery is necessary to ligate the ductus. If symptoms are mild, surgicalcorrection is usually delayed until the infant is between ages 6 months and 3years, unless problems develop. Before surgery, children with PDA requireantibiotics to protect against infective endocarditis.Other forms of therapy include cardiac catheterization to deposit a plug orcoil in the ductus to stop shunting or administration of indomethacin IV. (aprostaglandin inhibitor that s an altemative to surgery in premature neonates)to induce ductus spasm and closure.Special Considerations PDA necessitates careful monitoring, patient and family teaching, andemotional support. Watch carefully for signs of PDA in all premature neonates. Be alert for respiratory distress symptoms resulting from heart failure,which may develop rapidly in a premature neonate. Frequently assessvital signs, ECG, electrolyte levels, and intake and output. Recordresponse to diuretics and other therapy. Watch for signs of digoxin toxicity(poor feeding and vomiting). Ifthe infant receives indomethacin for ductus closure, watch for possibleadverse effects, such as diarrhea, jaundice, bleeding, and renaldysfunction. Before surgery, carefully explain all treatments and tests to parents.Include the child in your explanations. Arrange for the child and herparents to meet the ICU staff. Tell them about expected I.V. lines,monitoring equipment, and postoperative procedures. Immediately after surgery, the child may have a CVP catheter and anarterial line in place. Carefully assess vital signs, intake and output, and",19,109
55,"arterial and venous pressures. Provide pain relief as needed. Before discharge, review instructions to the parents about activityrestrictions based on the child s tolerance and energy levels. Adviseparents not to become overprotective as their child s tolerance forphysical activity increases. Stress the need for regular follow-up examinations. Advise parents toinform any practitioner who treats their child about the history of surgeryfor PDA even if the child is being treated for an unrelated medicalproblem.Congenital Cyanotic Defects TETRALOGY OF FALLOTCauses and Incidence Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination of four cardiac defects: VSD, rightventricular outflow tract obstruction (PS), right ventricular hypertrophy, anddextroposition of the aorta, with overriding of the VSD. Blood shunts right toleft through the VSD, permitting unoxygenated blood to mix with oxygenatedblood, resulting in cyanosis. Tetralogy of Fallot sometimes coexists withother congenital heart defects, such as PDA or ASD.The cause of tetralogy of Fallot is unknown, but it results fromembryologic hypoplasia of the outflow tract of the right ventricle. Multiplefactors, such as Down syndrome, have been associated with its presence.Prenatal risk factors include matemal rubella or other viral illnesses, poorprenatal nutrition, matemal alcoholism, mother older than age 40, anddiabetes.Tetralogy of Fallot occurs in about 5 of every 10,000 infants and accountsfor about 10 of all congenital heart diseases. It occurs equally in boys andgirls. Before surgical advances made correction possible, about one third ofthese children died in infancy.Pathophysiology Tetralogy of Fallot is present at birth.Pathophysiology depends on the degree of right ventricular outflowobstruction. A mild obstruction may result in a net left-to-right shunt through",12,91
56,"the VSD; a severe obstruction causes a right-to-left shunt, resulting in lowsystemic arterial saturation (cyanosis) that is unresponsive to supplementaloxygen.Each patient may have a varying degree of defect.Complications Cerebral abscess Pulmonary thrombosis Venous thrombosis Cerebral embolism Infective endocarditis Signs and Symptoms Generally, the hallmark of the disorder is cyanosis, which usually becomesevident within several months after birth but may be present at birth if theneonate has severe PS. Between ages 2 months and 2 years, children withtetralogy of Fallot may experience cyanotic or tet spells. Such spells resultfrom increased right-to-left shunting, possibly caused by spasm of the rightventricular outflow tract, increased systemic venous retum, or decreasedsystemic arterial resistance.Exercise, crying, straining, infection, or fever can precipitate blue spells.Blue spells are characterized by dyspnea; deep, sighing respirations;bradycardia; fainting; seizures; and loss of consciousness. Older childrenmay also develop other signs of poor oxygenation, such as clubbing,diminished exercise tolerance, increasing dyspnea on exertion, growthretardation, and eating difficulties. These children habitually squat when theyfeel short of breath; this is thought to decrease venous retum of unoxygenatedblood from the legs and increase systemic arterial resistance.Children with tetralogy of Fallot also risk developing cerebral abscesses,pulmonary thrombosis, venous thrombosis or cerebral embolism, andinfective endocarditis.In females with tetralogy of Fallot who live to childbearing age, theincidence of spontaneous abortion, premature births, and low birth weightrises.Diagnosis",5,94
57,"In a patient with tetralogy of Fallot, auscultation detects a loud systolic heartmurmur (best heard along the left stemal border), which may diminish orobscure the pulmonic component of S,. In a patient with a large PDA, thecontinuous murmur of the ductus obscures the systolic murmur. Palpation mayreveal a cardiac thrill at the left stemal border and an obvious rightventricular impulse. The inferior stemum appears prominent.The results of special tests also support the diagnosis:Chest X-ray may demonstrate decreased pulmonary vascular marking,depending on the pulmonary obstruction s severity, and a boot-shapedcardiac silhouette. ECG shows right ventricular hypertrophy, right axis deviation, and,possibly, right atrial hypertrophy.Echocardiography identifies septal overriding of the aorta, the VSD, and PS and detects the hypertrophied walls of the right ventricle. Pulse oximetry shows a decrease in oxygen saturation.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Cardiac catheterization confirms thediagnosis by visualizing PS, the VSD, and the overriding aorta andruling out other cyanotic heart defects. This test also measures the degreeof oxygen saturation in aortic blood.Treatment Effective management of tetralogy of Fallot necessitates prevention andtreatment of complications, measures to relieve cyanosis, and palliative orcorrective surgery. During cyanotic spells, the knee chest position andadministration of oxygen and morphine improve oxygenation. Propranolol (abeta-adrenergic blocking agent) may prevent blue spells.Palliative surgery is performed in infants with potentially fatal hypoxicspells or occasionally needed prior to final correction. The goal of surgery isto enhance blood flow to the lungs to reduce hypoxia; this is oftenaccomplished by joining the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery(modified Blalock-Taussig procedure). Supportive measures includeprophylactic antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis or cerebral abscessadministered before, during, and after bowel, bladder, or any other surgeryor dental treatments. Management may also include phlebotomy in childrenwith polycythemia.",12,101
58,"Complete corrective surgery to relieve PS and close the VSD, directingleft ventricular outflow to the aorta, requires cardiopulmonary bypass withhypothermia to decrease oxygen utilization during surgery, especially inyoung children. An infant may have this corrective surgery without priorpalliative surgery. It s usually done when progressive hypoxia andpolycythemia impair the quality of life, rather than at a specific age.However, most children require surgery, some as young as 6 months old aslong as oxygen levels remain adequate.Special Considerations Explain tetralogy of Fallot to the parents. Inform them that their child willset their own exercise limits and will know when to rest. Make sure theyunderstand that their child can engage in physical activity, and advise themnot to be overprotective.Teach the parents to recognize serious hypoxic spells, which candramatically increase cyanosis; deep, sighing respirations; and loss ofconsciousness. Tell them to place their child in the knee chest positionand to report such spells immediately. Emergency treatment may benecessary.Instruct the parents on ways to prevent overexerting their child, such asfeeding slowly and providing smaller and more frequent meals. Tell themthat remaining calm may decrease anxiety and that anticipating needs mayminimize crying. Encourage the parents to recruit other family members inthe care of the child to help prevent their own exhaustion.To prevent infective endocarditis and other infections, wam the parents tokeep their child away from people with infections. Urge them toencourage good dental hygiene, and tell them to watch for ear, nose, andthroat infections and dental caries, all of which necessitate immediatetreatment. When dental care, infections, or surgery requires prophylacticantibiotics, tell the parents to make sure the child completes theprescribed regimen. Ifthe child requires medical attention for an unrelated problem, advise theparents to inform the practitioner immediately of the child s history oftetralogy of Fallot because any treatment must take this serious heartdefect into consideration. During hospitalization, alert the staff to the child s condition. Because ofthe right-to-left shunt through the VSD, treat IV. lines like arterial lines. A",16,105
59,"clot dislodged from a catheter tip in a vein can cross the VSD and causecerebral embolism. The same thing can happen if air enters the venouslines.After palliative surgery: Monitor oxygenation and arterial blood gas (ABG) values closely in the ICU. Ifthe child has undergone the modified Blalock Taussig procedure, don tuse the arm on the operative side for measuring blood pressure, inserting LV. lines, or drawing blood samples, because blood perfusion on this sidediminishes greatly until collateral circulation develops. Note this on thechild s chart and at the bedside.After corrective surgery: Watch for right bundle branch block or more serious disturbances of AVconduction and for ventricular ectopic beats. Be alert for other postoperative complications, such as bleeding, right-sided heart failure, and respiratory failure. After surgery, transient heartfailure is common and may require treatment with digoxin and diuretics. Monitor left atrial pressure directly. A pulmonary artery catheter may alsobe used to check central venous and PAPs. Frequently check color and vital signs. Obtain ABG measurementsregularly to assess oxygenation. Suction to prevent atelectasis andpneumonia, as needed. Monitor mechanical ventilation. Monitor and record intake and output accurately. If atrioventricular block develops with a low heart rate, a temporary extemalpacemaker may be necessary. If blood pressure or cardiac output is inadequate, catecholamines may beordered by continuous I.V. infusion. To decrease left ventricularworkload, administer nitroprusside, if ordered, and provide analgesics, asneeded.Keep the parents informed about their child s progress. After discharge,the child may require digoxin, diuretics, and other drugs. Stress theimportance of complying with the prescribed regimen, and make sure theparents know how and when to administer these medications. Teach theparents to watch for signs of digoxin toxicity (anorexia, nausea, andvomiting). Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis will",22,104
60,"still be required. Advise the parents to avoid becoming overprotective asthe child s tolerance for physical activity rises.TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT ARTERIESCauses and Incidence In this congenital heart defect, the great arteries are reversed: the aorta arisesfrom the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle,producing two noncommunicating circulatory systems (pulmonary andsystemic). Transposition accounts for about 3 of all congenital heartdefects and often coexists with other congenital heart defects, such as VSD,VSD with PS, ASD, and PDA. It affects two to three times more males thanfemales. Transposition of the great arteries results from faulty embryonicdevelopment, but the cause of such development is unknown. Transpositionof the great arteries occurs in about 30 of every 100,000 infants.Pathophysiology In transposition, oxygenated blood retuming to the left side of the heart iscarried back to the lungs by a transposed pulmonary artery; unoxygenatedblood retuming to the right side of the heart is carried to the systemiccirculation by a transposed aorta.Communication between the pulmonary and systemic circulations isnecessary for survival. In infants with isolated transposition, blood mixesonly at the patent foramen ovale and at the PDA, resulting in slight mixing ofunoxygenated systemic blood and oxygenated pulmonary blood. In infantswith concurrent cardiac defects, greater mixing of blood occurs.Complications Chronic heart failure Poor oxygenation Arrhythmias Right-sided heart failure Signs and Symptoms Within the first few hours after birth, neonates with transposition of the greatarteries and no other heart defects generally show cyanosis and tachypnea,",8,78
61,"which worsen with crying. After several days or weeks, such neonatesusually develop signs of heart failure (gallop rhythm, tachycardia, dyspnea,hepatomegaly, and cardiomegaly). S, is louder than normal because theanteriorly transposed aorta is directly behind the stemum; in many cases,however, no murmur can be heard during the first few days of life.Associated defects (ASD, VSD, or PDA) cause their typical murmurs andmay minimize cyanosis but may also cause other complications (especiallysevere heart failure). VSD with PS produces a characteristic murmur andsevere cyanosis.As infants with this defect grow older, cyanosis is their most prominentabnormality. However, they also develop diminished exercise tolerance,fatigability, coughing, clubbing, and more pronounced murmurs if ASD, VSD,PDA, or PS is present.Diagnosis Chest X-rays are normal in the first days of life. Within days to weeks,right atrial and right ventricular enlargement characteristically cause theheart to appear oblong. X-rays also show increased pulmonary vascularmarkings, except when PS coexists.ECG typically reveals right axis deviation and right ventricularhypertrophy but may be normal in a neonate.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Echocardiography demonstrates thereversed position of the aorta and pulmonary artery and recordsechoes from both semilunar valves simultaneously, due to aortic valvedisplacement. It also detects other cardiac defects. Cardiaccatheterization reveals decreased oxygen saturation in left ventricularblood and aortic blood; increased right atrial, right ventricular, andpulmonary artery oxygen saturation; and right ventricular systolicpressure equal to systemic pressure. Dye injection reveals thetransposed vessels and the presence of any other cardiac defects. ABG measurements indicate hypoxia and secondary metabolic acidosis.Treatment An infant with transposition may undergo atrial balloon septostomy(Rashkind procedure) during cardiac catheterization. This procedure",12,103
62,"enlarges the patent foramen ovale, which improves oxygenation by allowinggreater mixing of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Atrial balloonseptostomy requires passage of a balloon-tipped catheter through the foramenovale and subsequent inflation and withdrawal across the atrial septum. Thisprocedure alleviates hypoxia to a certain degree. Afterward, digoxin anddiuretics can lessen heart failure until the infant is ready to withstandcorrective surgery (usually by 1 to 2 weeks of age).One of three surgical procedures can correct transposition, depending onthe defect s physiology. The Mustard procedure replaces the atrial septumwith a Dacron or pericardial partition that allows systemic venous blood tobe channeled to the pulmonary artery which carries the blood to the lungsfor oxygenation and oxygenated blood retuming to the heart to be channeledfrom the pulmonary veins into the aorta. The Senning procedureaccomplishes the same result, using the atrial septum to create partitions toredirect blood flow. In the arterial switch, or Jantene procedure, transposedarteries are surgically anastomosed to the correct ventricle. For thisprocedure to be successful, the left ventricle must be used to pump atsystemic pressure, as it does in neonates or in children with a left ventricularoutflow obstruction or a large VSD. The Jantene procedure is the procedureof choice; however, the Mustard and Senning procedures may be used whenspecific anatomic conditions exist.Special Considerations Explain cardiac catheterization and all necessary procedures to theparents. Offer emotional support. Monitor vital signs, ABG values, urine output, and CVP, watching forsigns of heart failure. Give digoxin and I.V. fluids, being careful to avoidfluid overload. Teach the parents to recognize signs of heart failure and digoxin toxicity(poor feeding and vomiting). Stress the importance of regular checkups tomonitor cardiovascular status. Teach the parents to protect their infant from infection and to giveantibiotics. Tell the parents to let their child develop normally. They need not restrictactivities; let the child set his or her own limits.If the patient is scheduled for surgery, explain the procedure to the parentsand child, if old enough. Teach them about the ICU and introduce them to",19,108
63,"the staff. Also explain postoperative care. Preoperatively, monitor ABG values, acid base balance, intake andoutput, and vital signs.After corrective surgery: Monitor cardiac output by checking blood pressure, skin color, heart rate,urine output, central venous and left atrial pressures, and level ofconsciousness (LOC). Report abnormalities or changes. Carefully monitor ABG levels and report changes in trends. To detect supraventricular conduction blocks and arrhythmias, monitor thepatient closely. Watch for signs of atrioventricular blocks, atrial arrhythmias, andfaulty sinoatrial function. After the Mustard or Senning procedure, watch for signs of baffleobstruction such as marked facial edema. Encourage parents to help their child assume new activity levels andindependence. Teach them about postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis forendocarditis.Acquired Inflammatory Heart Disease MYOCARDITISCauses and Incidence Myocarditis is focal or diffuse inflammation of the cardiac muscle(myocardium). It may be acute or chronic and can occur at any age. In manycases, myocarditis fails to produce specific cardiovascular symptoms orelectrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, and recovery is_ usuallyspontaneous, without residual defects. Occasionally, myocarditis iscomplicated by heart failure; in rare cases, it leads to cardiomyopathy.Myocarditis may result from: bacterial infections diphtheria; tuberculosis; typhoid fever; tetanus; andstaphylococcal, pneumococcal, and gonococcal infections chemical poisons such as chronic alcoholism helminthic infections such as trichinosis hypersensitive immune reactions acute rheumatic fever andpostcardiotomy syndrome",13,85
64,"parasitic infections especially South American trypanosomiasis (Chagasdisease) in infants and immunosuppressed adults; also toxoplasmosis radiation therapy large doses of radiation to the chest in treating lung orbreast cancer viral infections (most common cause in the United States and Westem Europe) coxsackievirus A and B strains and, possibly, poliomyelitis,influenza, rubeola, rubella, and adenoviruses and echoviruses Myocarditis occurs in 1 to 10 of every 100,000 people in the United States. The median age for this disorder is 42, and incidence is equalbetween males and females. Children, especially neonates, and persons whoare immunocompromised or pregnant (especially pregnant black women) areat higher risk for developing this disorder.Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of myocarditis is still being researched, but it is usuallycaused by a virus, as already mentioned. It results in necrosis of myocardialcells either through direct injury or as a result of an autoimmune reaction ofan infectious or toxic process. The extent of the involvement depends on themagnitude of the insult; if it extends to the pericardium, myopericarditisoccurs.Complications Arrhythmias Thromboembolism Chronic valvulitis (when disease results from rheumatic fever) Recurrence of disease Left-sided heart failure (occasional)Cardiomyopathy (rare)Signs and symptoms Myocarditis usually causes nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea,palpitations, and fever that reflect the accompanying systemic infection.Occasionally, it may produce mild, continuous pressure or soreness in thechest (unlike the recurring, stress-related pain of angina pectoris). Althoughmyocarditis is usually self-limiting, it may induce myofibril degeneration thatresults in right- and left-sided heart failure, with cardiomegaly, JVD,",6,89
65,"dyspnea, persistent fever with resting or exertional tachycardiadisproportionate to the degree of fever, and supraventricular and ventriculararrhythmias. Sometimes myocarditis recurs or produces chronic valvulitis(when it results from rheumatic fever), cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, andthromboembolism.Diagnosis Patient history commonly reveals recent febrile upper respiratory tractinfection, viral pharyngitis, or tonsillitis. Physical examination showssupraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, S, and S, gallops, a faint S,,possibly a murmur of mitral insufficiency (from papillary muscledysfunction) and, if pericarditis is present, a pericardial friction rub.Laboratory tests can t unequivocally confirm myocarditis, but thefollowing findings support this diagnosis: cardiac enzymes: elevated CK, CK-MB, aspartate aminotransferase, andlactate dehydrogenase levels increased white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate elevated antibody titers (such as antistreptolysin-O titer in rheumaticfever)CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Endomyocardial biopsy is rarely performed todiagnose myocarditis; the procedure is invasive and costly. A negativebiopsy doesn t exclude the diagnosis, and a repeat biopsy may be needed.ECG typically shows diffuse ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities as inpericarditis, conduction defects (prolonged PR _ interval), and othersupraventricular arrhythmias. Echocardiography demonstrates some degreeof left ventricular dysfunction, and radionuclide scanning may identifyinflammatory and necrotic changes characteristic of myocarditis.Stool and throat cultures may identify bacteria.Treatment While myositis is usually self-limiting, treatment may include antibiotics forbacterial infection, modified bed rest to decrease cardiac workload, andcareful management of complications. Inotropic support of cardiac functionwith amrinone, dopamine, or dobutamine may be needed. Heart failure",7,93
66,"requires restriction of activity to minimize myocardial oxygen consumption,supplemental oxygen therapy, sodium restriction, diuretics to decrease fluidretention, and cardiac glycosides to increase myocardial contractility.However, cardiac glycosides should be administered cautiously becausesome patients with myocarditis may show a paradoxical sensitivity to evensmall doses. Arrhythmias necessitate prompt but cautious administration ofantiarrhythmics because these drugs depress myocardial contractility.Thromboembolism requires anticoagulation therapy. Treatment withcorticosteroids or other immunosuppressants may be used to reduceinflammation, but they haven t been shown to change the progression ofmyocarditis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicatedduring the acute phase (first 2 weeks) because they increase myocardialdamage.Surgical treatment may include left ventricular assistive devices andextracorporeal membrane oxygenation for support of cardiogenic shock.Cardiac transplantation has been beneficial for giant cell myocarditis.Special Considerations Assess cardiovascular status frequently, watching for signs of heartfailure, such as dyspnea, hypotension, and tachycardia. Check for changesin cardiac rhythm or conduction. Observe for signs of digoxin toxicity (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, blurredvision, and cardiac arrhythmias) and for complicating factors that maypotentiate toxicity, such as electrolyte imbalance or hypoxia. Stress the importance of bed rest. Assist with bathing, as necessary;provide a bedside commode because this stresses the heart less than usinga bedpan. Reassure the patient that activity limitations are temporary.Offer diversional activities that are physically undemanding.During recovery, recommend that the patient resume normal activitiesslowly and avoid competitive sports. PREVENTION Instruct patient to obtain prompt treatment of causative disorders. Instruct patient to practice good hygiene, including thoroughhandwashing.",11,90
67,"Tell patient to thoroughly wash and cook food.ENDOCARDITISCauses and Incidence Endocarditis (also known as infective or bacterial endocarditis) is aninfection of the endocardium, heart valves, or cardiac prostheses resultingfrom bacterial or fungal invasion. Most cases of endocarditis occur in LV.drug abusers, patients with prosthetic heart valves, and those with MVP(especially males with a systolic murmur). These conditions have surpassedrheumatic heart disease as the leading risk factor. Other predisposingconditions include coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of Fallot, subaortic andvalvular aortic stenosis, VSDs, PS, Marfan syndrome, degenerative heartdisease (especially calcific aortic stenosis), and, rarely, syphilitic aorticvalve. However, some patients with endocarditis have no underlying heartdisease. In the United States, endocarditis affects 2 to 6 people out of every100,000. Males are twice as likely as females to acquire this infection, andthe mean age of onset is 50. Mortality is associated with increased age,infection of the aortic valve, heart failure and underlying heart disease, andcentral nervous system complications; mortality rates vary with the infectingorganism. Untreated endocarditis is usually fatal, but with proper treatment,70 of patients recover. The prognosis is worst when endocarditis causessevere valvular damage, leading to insufficiency and heart failure, or when itinvolves a prosthetic valve.Pathophysiology The invasion of bacteria or fungi produces vegetative growths on the heartvalves, endocardial lining of a heart chamber, or endothelium of a bloodvessel that may embolize to the spleen, kidneys, central nervous system, andlungs. In endocarditis, fibrin and platelets aggregate on the valve tissue andengulf circulating bacteria or fungi that flourish and produce friableverrucous vegetations. (See Degenerative changes in endocarditis.) Suchvegetations may cover the valve surfaces, causing ulceration and necrosis;they may also extend to the chordae tendineae, leading to their rupture andsubsequent valvular insufficiency.",13,102
68,"Degenerative Changes in Endocarditis This illustration shows typical vegetations on the endocardium producedby fibrin and platelet deposits on infection sites. Infecting organisms differ depending on the cause of endocarditis. Inpatients with native valve endocarditis who aren t I.V. drug abusers,causative organisms usually include in the order of frequency streptococci (especially Streptococcus viridans), staphylococci, orenterococci. Although many other bacteria occasionally cause the disorder,fungal causes are rare in this group. The mitral valve is involved mostcommonly, followed by the aortic valve.In patients who are I.V. drug abusers, Staphylococcus aureus is the mostcommon infecting organism. Less commonly, streptococci, enterococci,gram-negative bacilli, or fungi cause the disorder. The tricuspid valve isinvolved most commonly, followed by the aortic and then the mitral valve.",9,41
69,"In patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis, early cases (those thatdevelop within 60 days of valve insertion) are usually due to staphylococcalinfection. However, gram-negative aerobic organisms, fungi, streptococci,enterococci, or diphtheroids may also cause the disorder. The course isusually fulminant and is associated with a high mortality. Late cases(occurring after 60 days) present similar to native valve endocarditis.Complications Left-sided heart failure Valvular stenosis or insufficiency Myocardial erosion Signs and Symptoms Early clinical features of endocarditis are usually nonspecific and includemalaise, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, arthralgia, night sweats,chills, valvular insufficiency and, in 90 of patients, an intermittent feverthat may recur for weeks. A more acute onset is associated with organisms ofhigh pathogenicity such as S. aureus. Endocarditis commonly causes a loud,regurgitant murmur typical of the underlying heart lesion. A suddenlychanging murmur or the discovery of a new murmur in the presence of feveris a classic physical sign of endocarditis.In about 30 of patients, embolization from vegetating lesions or diseasedvalvular tissue may produce typical features of splenic, renal, cerebral, orpulmonary infarction or of peripheral vascular occlusion: splenic infarction pain in the left upper quadrant, radiating to the leftshoulder, and abdominal rigidity renal infarction hematuria, pyuria, flank pain, and decreased urineoutput cerebral infarction hemiparesis, aphasia, or other neurologic deficits pulmonary infarction (most common in right-sided endocarditis, whichcommonly occurs among I. V. drug abusers and after cardiac surgery) cough, pleuritic pain, pleural friction rub, dyspnea, and hemoptysis peripheral vascular occlusion numbness and tingling in an arm, leg,finger, or toe, or signs of impending peripheral gangrene Other signs may include splenomegaly; petechiae of the skin (especiallycommon on the upper anterior trunk) and the buccal, pharyngeal, or",7,104
70,"conjunctival mucosa; and splinter hemorrhages under the nails. Rarely,endocarditis produces Osler nodes (tender, raised, subcutaneous lesions onthe fingers or toes), Roth spots (hemorrhagic areas with white centers on theretina), and Janeway lesions (purplish macules on the palms or soles).Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Three or more blood cultures in a 24- to 48-hour period (each from a separate venipuncture) identify the causativeorganism in up to 90 of patients. Blood cultures should be drawn fromthree different sites with I hour between each draw.The remaining 10 may have negative blood cultures, possibly suggestingfungal infection or infections that are difficult to diagnose, such as Haemophilus parainfluenzae.Other abnormal but nonspecific laboratory test results include: normal or elevated white blood cell count abnormal histiocytes (macrophages) elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate normocytic, normochromic anemia (in 70 to 90 of patients) proteinuria and microscopic hematuria (in about 50 of patients) positive serum rheumatoid factor (in about 50 of patients afterendocarditis is present for 3 to 6 weeks)Echocardiography (particularly, transesophageal) may identify valvulardamage; ECG may show atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias thataccompany valvular disease.Treatment The goal of treatment is to eradicate the infecting organism with appropriateantimicrobial therapy, which should start promptly and continue over 4 to 6weeks. Selection of an antibiotic is based on identification of the infectingorganism and on sensitivity studies. While awaiting results, or if bloodcultures are negative, empiric antimicrobial therapy is based on the likelyinfecting organism.Supportive treatment includes bed rest, aspirin for fever and aches, andsufficient fluid intake. Severe valvular damage, especially aortic or mitral",6,87
71,"insufficiency, may require corrective surgery if refractory heart failuredevelops, or in cases requiring that an infected prosthetic valve be replaced.Special considerations Before giving antibiotics, obtain a patient history of allergies. Administerantibiotics on time to maintain consistent antibiotic blood levels. Observe for signs of infiltration or inflammation at the venipuncture site,possible complications of long-term IV. drug administration. To reducethe risk of these complications, rotate venous access sites. Watch for signs of embolization (hematuria, pleuritic chest pain, left upperquadrant pain, or paresis), a common occurrence during the first 3 monthsof treatment. Tell the patient to watch for and report these signs, whichmay indicate impending peripheral vascular occlusion or splenic, renal,cerebral, or pulmonary infarction.Monitor the patient s renal status (blood urea nitrogen BUN levels,creatinine clearance, and urine output) to check for signs of renal embolior evidence of drug toxicity.Observe for signs of heart failure, such as dyspnea, tachypnea,tachycardia, crackles, JVD, edema, and weight gain.Provide reassurance by teaching the patient and family about this diseaseand the need for prolonged treatment. Tell them to watch closely for fever,anorexia, and other signs of relapse about 2 weeks after treatment stops.Suggest quiet diversionary activities to prevent excessive physicalexertion.Make sure susceptible patients understand the need for prophylacticantibiotics before, during, and after dental work, childbirth, andgenitourinary, GI, or gynecologic procedures.Teach patients how to recognize symptoms of endocarditis and tell them tonotify the practitioner at once if such symptoms occur. (See Preventingendocarditis.)PREVENTIONPREVENTING ENDOCARDITISAny patient who is at risk for or susceptible to endocarditis, such asthose with artificial heart valves or other predisposing factors, should",10,99
72,"have prophylactic antibiotics before dental or other invasiveprocedures.In addition, the patient should practice good hygiene, includingthoroughly washing hands and washing fruits and vegetables andthoroughly cooking all food to prevent introducing organisms into thesystem. Maintaining good oral health by daily brushing and flossingand having regular dental checkups can also prevent infection. Be sureto advise the patient to notify the family practitioner as well as thedentist or another specialist that they have a condition that places themat high risk for endocarditis.PERICARDITISCauses and Incidence Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the fibroserous sac thatenvelops, supports, and protects the heart. Common causes of this diseaseinclude: bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (infectious pericarditis) neoplasms (primary or metastatic from lungs, breasts, or other organs) high-dose radiation to the chest uremia hypersensitivity or autoimmune disease, such as acute rheumatic fever(most common cause of pericarditis in children), systemic lupuserythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis postcardiac injury such as MI, which later causes an autoimmune reaction(Dressler syndrome) in the pericardium; trauma; or surgery that leaves thepericardium intact but causes blood to leak into the pericardial cavity drugs, such as hydralazine or procainamide idiopathic factors (most common in acute pericarditis)Less common causes include aortic aneurysm with pericardial leakage andmyxedema with cholesterol deposits in the pericardium.Pericarditis most commonly affects men 20 to 50 years old, but it can alsooccur in children after infection with an adenovirus or coxsackievirus.The prognosis depends on the underlying cause but is generally good inacute pericarditis, unless constriction occurs.",4,81
73,"Pathophysiology The pericardium protects the heart mechanically and reduces friction of thesurrounding structures through a small amount of pericardial fluid (25 to 50m L). Inflammation of the layers of the pericardium leads to an increase in theproduction of this fluid in the form of exudate. Pericarditis occurs in bothacute and chronic forms. Acute pericarditis can be fibrinous or effusive, withpurulent serous or hemorrhagic exudate; chronic constrictive pericarditis ischaracterized by dense fibrous pericardial thickening.Complications Pericardial effusion Cardiac tamponade Shock Cardiovascular collapse Death Signs and symptoms Acute pericarditis typically produces a sharp and often sudden pain thatusually starts over the stemum and radiates to the neck, shoulders, back, andarms. However, unlike the pain of MI, pericardial pain is often pleuritic,increasing with deep inspiration and decreasing when the patient sits up andleans forward, pulling the heart away from the diaphragmatic pleurae of thelungs.Pericardial effusion, the major complication of acute pericarditis, mayproduce effects of heart failure (such as dyspnea, orthopnea, andtachycardia), ill-defined substemal chest pain, and a feeling of fullness in thechest. (See Pattems of cardiac pain.)Pattems of cardiac pain Although pain perception is individualistic, specific characteristics areassociated with different types of cardiac pain, as shown below.Pericarditis Angina Myocardial infarction",7,74

75,"Diagnosis Because pericarditis commonly coexists with other conditions, the diagnosisof acute pericarditis depends on typical clinical features and elimination ofother possible causes. The pericardial friction rub, a classic symptom, is agrating sound heard as the heart moves. It can usually be auscultated bestduring forced expiration, while the patient leans forward or is on hands andknees in bed. It may have up to three components, corresponding to the timingof atrial systole, ventricular systole, and the rapid-filling phase of ventriculardiastole. Occasionally, this friction rub is heard only briefly or not at all.Nevertheless, its presence, together with other characteristic features, isdiagnostic of acute pericarditis. In addition, if acute pericarditis has causedvery large pericardial effusions, physical examination reveals increasedcardiac dullness and diminished or absent apical impulse and distant heartsounds.Chest X-ray, echocardiogram, chest MRI, heart MRI, heart computedtomography scan, and radionuclide scanning can detect fluid that hasaccumulated in the pericardial sac. They may also show enlargement of theheart and signs of inflammation or scarring, depending on the cause ofpericarditis.In patients with chronic pericarditis, acute inflammation or effusions don toccur only restricted cardiac filling.Laboratory results reflect inflammation and may identify its cause: normal or elevated white blood cell count, especially in infectiouspericarditis elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate slightly elevated cardiac enzyme levels with associated myocarditis culture of pericardial fluid obtained by open surgical drainage orcardiocentesis (sometimes identifies a causative organism in bacterial orfungal pericarditis)ECG showing the following changes in acute pericarditis: elevation of STsegments in the standard limb leads and most precordial leads without thesignificant changes in QRS morphology that occur with MI, atrial ectopicrhythms such as atrial fibrillation and, in pericardial effusion, diminished QRS voltage Other pertinent laboratory data include BUN levels to check for uremia,antistreptolysin-O titers to detect rheumatic fever, and a purified protein",7,102
76,"derivative skin test to check for tuberculosis. In pericardial effusion,echocardiography is diagnostic when it shows an echo-free space betweenthe ventricular wall and the pericardium.Treatment The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and manage the underlyingsystemic disease. In acute idiopathic pericarditis and postthoracotomypericarditis, treatment consists of bed rest as long as fever and pain persist,and nonsteroidal drugs, such as aspirin and indomethacin, to relieve pain andreduce inflammation. Post-MI patients should avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids because they may interfere with myocardialscar formation. If these drugs fail to relieve symptoms, corticosteroids maybe used. Although corticosteroids produce rapid and effective relief, theymust be used cautiously because episodes may recur when therapy isdiscontinued.Infectious pericarditis that results from disease of the left pleural space,mediastinal abscesses, or septicemia requires antibiotics (possibly by directpericardial injection), surgical drainage, or both. Cardiac tamponade mayrequire pericardiocentesis. Signs of tamponade include pulsus paradoxus,JVD, dyspnea, and shock.Recurrent pericarditis may necessitate partial pericardectomy, whichcreates a window that allows fluid to drain into the pleural space. Inconstrictive pericarditis, total pericardectomy to permit adequate filling andcontraction of the heart may be necessary. Treatment must also includemanagement of rheumatic fever, uremia, tuberculosis, and other underlyingdisorders.Special considerations A patient with pericarditis needs complete bed rest. In addition, healthcareincludes: assessing pain in relation to respiration and body position to distinguishpericardial pain from myocardial ischemic pain placing the patient in an upright position to relieve dyspnea and chestpain; providing analgesics and oxygen; and reassuring the patient withacute pericarditis that the condition is temporary and treatable",11,98
77,"monitoring for signs of cardiac compression or cardiac tamponade,possible complications of pericardial effusion (Signs include decreasedblood pressure, increased CVP, and pulsus paradoxus. Because cardiactamponade requires immediate treatment, keep a pericardiocentesis sethandy whenever pericardial effusion is suspected.) explaining tests and treatments to the patient (If surgery is necessary, thepatient should leam deep breathing and coughing exercises beforehand.Postoperative care is similar to that given after cardiothoracic surgery.)RHEUMATIC FEVER AND RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASECauses and Incidence Acute rheumatic fever is a systemic inflammatory disease of childhood, inmany cases recurrent, that follows a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcalinfection. Rheumatic heart disease refers to the cardiac manifestations ofrheumatic fever and includes pancarditis (myocarditis, pericarditis, andendocarditis) during the early acute phase and chronic valvular disease later.Although rheumatic fever tends to be familial, this may merely reflectcontributing environmental factors. For example, in lower socioeconomicgroups, incidence is highest in children between 5 and 15 years old,probably as a result of malnutrition and crowded living conditions. Thisdisease strikes generally during cool, damp weather in the winter and earlyspring. In the United States, it s most common in the northem states. Long-term antibiotic therapy can minimize the recurrence of rheumatic fever,reducing the risk of permanent cardiac damage and eventual valvulardeformity. However, severe pancarditis occasionally produces fatal heartfailure during the acute phase. Of the patients who survive this complication,about 20 die within 10 years.Pathophysiology Rheumatic fever appears to be a hypersensitivity reaction to a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, in which antibodies manufactured tocombat streptococci react and produce characteristic lesions at specifictissue sites, especially in the heart and joints. Because very few persons(0.3 ) with streptococcal infections ever contract rheumatic fever, alteredhost resistance must be involved in its development or recurrence.",12,102
78,"Complications Destruction of mitral and aortic valves Severe pancarditis Pericardial effusion Fatal heart failure Signs and symptoms In 95 of patients, rheumatic fever characteristically follows a streptococcalinfection that appeared a few days to 6 weeks earlier. A temperature of atleast 100.4 F (38 C) occurs, and most patients complain of migratory jointpain or polyarthritis. Swelling, redness, and signs of effusion usuallyaccompany such pain, which most commonly affects the knees, ankles,elbows, or hips. In 5 of patients (generally those with carditis), rheumaticfever causes skin lesions such as erythema marginatum, a nonpruritic,macular, transient rash that gives rise to red lesions with blanched centers.Rheumatic fever may also produce firm, movable, nontender, subcutaneousnodules about 3 mm to 2 cm in diameter, usually near tendons or bonyprominences of joints (especially the elbows, knuckles, wrists, and knees)and less often on the scalp and backs of the hands. These nodules persist fora few days to several weeks and, like erythema marginatum, often accompanycarditis.Later, rheumatic fever may cause transient chorea, which develops up to 6months after the original streptococcal infection. Mild chorea may producehyperirritability, a deterioration in handwriting, or an inability toconcentrate. Severe chorea (Sydenham chorea) causes purposeless,nonrepetitive, involuntary muscle spasms; poor muscle coordination; andweakness. Chorea always resolves without residual neurologic damage.The most destructive effect of rheumatic fever is carditis, which developsin up to 50 of patients and may affect the endocardium, myocardium,pericardium, or the heart valves. Pericarditis causes a pericardial frictionrub and, occasionally, pain and effusion. Myocarditis produces characteristiclesions called Aschoff bodies (in the acute stages) and cellular swelling andfragmentation of interstitial collagen, leading to the formation of aprogressively fibrotic nodule and interstitial scars. Endocarditis causesvalve leaflet swelling; erosion along the lines of leaflet closure; and blood,platelet, and fibrin deposits, which form beadlike vegetations. Endocarditis",12,114
79,"affects the mitral valve most often in females and the aortic valve most oftenin males. In both females and males, endocarditis affects the tricuspid valvesoccasionally and the pulmonic valve only rarely.Severe rheumatic carditis may cause heart failure with dyspnea; rightupper quadrant pain; tachycardia; tachypnea; a hacking, nonproductive cough;edema; and significant mitral and aortic murmurs. The most common of suchmurmurs include: a systolic murmur of mitral insufficiency (high-pitched, blowing,holosystolic, loudest at apex, possibly radiating to the anterior axillaryline) a midsystolic murmur due to stiffening and swelling of the mitral leaflet occasionally, a diastolic murmur of aortic insufficiency (low-pitched,rumbling, almost inaudible). Valvular disease may eventually result inchronic valvular stenosis and insufficiency, including mitral stenosis andinsufficiency, and aortic insufficiency. In children, mitral insufficiencyremains the major sequela of rheumatic heart disease.Diagnosis Diagnosis depends on recognition of one or more of the classic symptoms(carditis, rheumatic fever without carditis, polyarthritis, chorea, erythemamarginatum, or subcutaneous nodules) and a detailed patient history.Laboratory data support the diagnosis: White blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate may beelevated (during the acute phase); blood studies show slight anemia due tosuppressed erythropoiesis during inflammation. C-reactive protein is positive (especially during the acute phase).Cardiac enzyme levels may be increased in severe carditis. Antistreptolysin-O titer is elevated in 95 of patients within 2 months ofonset. Electrocardiogram changes aren t diagnostic, but PR interval is prolongedin 20 of patients.Chest X-rays show normal heart size (except with myocarditis, heartfailure, or pericardial effusion). Echocardiography helps evaluate valvular damage, chamber size, andventricular function.",9,104
80,"Cardiac catheterization evaluates valvular damage and left ventricularfunction in severe cardiac dysfunction.Treatment Effective management eradicates the streptococcal infection, relievessymptoms, and prevents recurrence, reducing the chance of permanentcardiac damage. During the acute phase, treatment includes penicillin,sulfadiazine, or erythromycin. Salicylates such as aspirin relieve fever andminimize joint swelling and pain; if carditis is present or salicylates fail torelieve pain and inflammation, corticosteroids may be used. Supportivetreatment requires strict bed rest for about 5 weeks during the acute phasewith active carditis, followed by a progressive increase in physical activity,depending on clinical and laboratory findings and the response to treatment.After the acute phase subsides, low-dose antibiotics may be used toprevent recurrence. Such preventive treatment usually continues for 5 yearsor until age 21 (whichever is longer). Heart failure necessitates continuedbed rest and diuretics. Severe mitral or aortic valve dysfunction that causespersistent heart failure requires corrective valvular surgery, includingcommissurotomy (separation of the adherent, thickened leaflets of the mitralvalve), valvuloplasty (inflation of a balloon within a valve), or valvereplacement (with prosthetic valve). Such surgery is seldom necessarybefore late adolescence.Special Considerations Because rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease require prolongedtreatment, the care plan should include comprehensive patient teaching topromote compliance with the prescribed therapy. Before giving penicillin, ask the patient or parents if the patient has everhad a hypersensitivity reaction to it. If not, wam that such a reaction ispossible. Tell them to stop the drug and call the practitioner immediatelyif the patient develops a rash, fever, chills, or other signs of allergy at anytime during penicillin therapy. Instruct the patient and family to watch for and report early signs of heartfailure, such as dyspnea and a hacking, nonproductive cough. Stress the need for bed rest during the acute phase, and suggestappropriate, physically undemanding diversions. After the acute phase,",14,118
81,"encourage family and friends to spend as much time as possible with thepatient to minimize boredom. Advise parents to secure tutorial services tohelp the child keep up with schoolwork during the long convalescence.Help the child s parents overcome any guilt feelings they may have aboutthe illness. Tell them that failure to seek treatment for streptococcalinfection is common because this illness often seems no worse than acold. Encourage the child and his or her parents to vent their frustrationsduring the long, tedious recovery. If the child has severe carditis, helpthem prepare for permanent changes in lifestyle.Teach the patient and his or her family about this disease and its treatment.Wam parents to watch for and immediately report signs of recurrentstreptococcal infection sudden sore throat, diffuse throat redness andoropharyngeal exudate, swollen and tender cervical lymph glands, pain onswallowing, temperature of 101 to 104 F (38.3 to 40 C), headache,and nausea. Urge them to keep the child away from people withrespiratory tract infections.Promote good dental hygiene to prevent gingival infection. Make sure thepatient and his or her family understand the need to comply withprolonged antibiotic therapy and follow-up care and the need foradditional antibiotics during dental surgery or procedures. Arrange for ahome health nurse to oversee home care if necessary.Teach the patient to follow current recommendations of the American Heart Association for prevention of bacterial endocarditis. Antibioticregimens used to prevent recurrence of acute rheumatic fever areinadequate for preventing bacterial endocarditis.

A combination of these three in the same valvemay also occur. They can result from such disorders as endocarditis (mostcommon), congenital defects, and inflammation, and they can lead to heartfailure.Valvular heart disease occurs in varying forms, described in the following. Mitral insufficiency: In this form, blood from the left ventricle flows backinto the left atrium during systole, causing the atrium to enlarge toaccommodate the backflow. As a result, the left ventricle also dilates toaccommodate the increased volume of blood from the atrium and tocompensate for diminishing cardiac output. Ventricular hypertrophy andincreased end-diastolic pressure result in increased PAP, eventuallyleading to left- and right-sided heart failure. Mitral stenosis: Narrowing of the valve by valvular abnormalities,fibrosis, or calcification obstructs blood flow from the left atrium to theleft ventricle. Consequently, left atrial volume and pressure rise and thechamber dilates. Greater resistance to blood flow causes pulmonary",9,95
89,"hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right-sided heart failure.Also, inadequate filling of the left ventricle produces low cardiac output.Mitral valve prolapse: One or both valve leaflets protrude into the leftatrium. MVP is the term used when the anatomic prolapse is accompaniedby signs and symptoms unrelated to the valvular abnormality.Aortic insufficiency: Blood flows back into the left ventricle duringdiastole, causing fluid overload in the ventricle, which dilates andhypertrophies. The excess volume causes fluid overload in the left atrium,and, finally, the pulmonary system. Left-sided heart failure and pulmonaryedema eventually result.Aortic stenosis: Increased left ventricular pressure tries to overcome theresistance of the narrowed valvular opening. The added workloadincreases the demand for oxygen, whereas diminished cardiac outputcauses poor coronary artery perfusion, ischemia of the left ventricle, andleft-sided heart failure.Pulmonic insufficiency: Blood ejected into the pulmonary artery duringsystole flows back into the right ventricle during diastole, causing fluidoverload in the ventricle, ventricular hypertrophy and, finally, right-sidedheart failure.Pulmonic stenosis: Obstructed right ventricular outflow causes rightventricular hypertrophy, eventually resulting in right-sided heart failure.Tricuspid insufficiency: Blood flows back into the right atrium duringsystole, decreasing blood flow to the lungs and the left side of the heart.Cardiac output also lessens. Fluid overload in the right side of the heartcan eventually lead to right-sided heart failure.Tricuspid stenosis: Obstructed blood flow from the right atrium to theright ventricle causes the right atrium to dilate and hypertrophy.Eventually, this leads to right-sided heart failure and increases pressure inthe vena cava.Treatment Treatment depends on the nature and severity of associated symptoms. Forexample, heart failure requires diuretics, a sodium-restricted diet, and, inacute cases, oxygen. Other measures may include anticoagulant therapy orantiplatelet medications to prevent thrombus formation around diseased orreplaced valves, prophylactic antibiotics before and after surgery, and",8,106
90,"valvuloplasty. An IABP may be used temporarily to reduce backflow byenhancing forward blood flow into the aorta.If the patient has severe signs and symptoms that can t be managedmedically, open heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass for valve repairor replacement is indicated. Newer procedures are available, such astranscatheter aortic valve replacement, and may be an option, as well. This isa minimally invasive procedure that wedges a replacement valve in theposition of the old valve. This valve begins to take over the duties of the oldvalve while pushing the leaflets of the old valve away.Special considerations Watch closely for signs of heart failure or pulmonary edema and foradverse effects of drug therapy. Teach the patient about diet restrictions, medications, and the importanceof consistent follow-up care.If the patient undergoes surgery, watch for hypotension, arrhythmias, andthrombus formation. Monitor vital signs, ABG values, intake, output, dailyweight, blood chemistries, chest X-rays, and pulmonary artery catheterreadings.Degenerative Cardiovascular Disorders HYPERTENSIONCauses and Incidence Hypertension, an intermittent or sustained elevation in diastolic or systolicblood pressure, occurs as two major types: essential (idiopathic)hypertension, the most common, and secondary hypertension, which resultsfrom renal disease or another identifiable cause. Malignant hypertension is asevere, fulminant form of hypertension common to both types. Hypertensionis a major cause of stroke, cardiac disease, and renal failure. Hypertensionaffects 25 of adults in the United States. If untreated, it carries a highmortality. Risk factors for hypertension include family history, race (mostcommon in blacks), stress, obesity, a diet high in saturated fats or sodium,tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, and aging.",12,83
91,"Secondary hypertension may result from renal vascular disease;pheochromocytoma; primary hyperaldosteronism; Cushing syndrome; thyroid,pituitary, or parathyroid dysfunction; coarctation of the aorta; pregnancy;neurologic disorders; and use of hormonal contraceptives or other drugs,such as cocaine, epoetin alfa (erythropoietin), and cyclosporine.The prognosis is good if this disorder is detected early and treatmentbegins before complications develop. Severely elevated blood pressure(hypertensive crisis) may be fatal. (See What happens in a hypertensivecrisis, page 31.)PATHOPHYSIOLOGYWHAT HAPPENS IN A HYPERTENSIVE CRISISHypertensive crisis is a severe rise in arterial blood pressure caused bya disturbance in one or more of the regulating mechanisms.

93,"Cardiac output and PVR determine blood pressure. Increased blood volume,cardiac rate, and stroke volume as well as arteriolar vasoconstriction canraise blood pressure. The link to sustained hypertension, however, is unclear.Hypertension may also result from failure of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms: Renal hypoperfusion causes release of renin, which is converted byangiotensinogen, a liver enzyme, to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I isconverted to angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor. The resultingvasoconstriction increases afterload. Angiotensin II stimulates adrenalsecretion of aldosterone, which increases sodium reabsorption.Hypertonic-stimulated release of antidiuretic hormone from the pituitarygland follows, increasing water reabsorption, plasma volume, cardiacoutput, and blood pressure. Autoregulation changes an artery s diameter to maintain perfusion despitefluctuations in systemic blood pressure. The intrinsic mechanismsresponsible include stress relaxation (vessels gradually dilate when bloodpressure rises to reduce peripheral resistance) and capillary fluid shift(plasma moves between vessels and extravascular spaces to maintainintravascular volume). When the blood pressure drops, baroreceptors in the aortic arch andcarotid sinuses decrease their inhibition of the medulla s vasomotorcenter, which increases sympathetic stimulation of the heart bynorepinephrine. This, in tum, increases cardiac output by strengthening thecontractile force, increasing the heart rate, and augmenting peripheralresistance by vasoconstriction. Stress can also stimulate the sympatheticnervous system to increase cardiac output and PVR.Complications Stroke Coronary artery disease Angina Myocardial infarction Heart failure Arrhythmias Sudden death Cerebral infarction Hypertensive encephalopathy",10,94
94,"Hypertensive retinopathy Renal failure Signs and Symptoms Hypertension usually doesn t produce clinical effects until vascular changesin the heart, brain, or kidneys occur. Severely elevated blood pressuredamages the intima of small vessels, resulting in fibrin accumulation in thevessels, development of local edema and, possibly, intravascular clotting.Symptoms produced by this process depend on the location of the damagedvessels: brain stroke retina blindness heart myocardial infarction kidneys proteinuria, edema, and, eventually, renal failure Hypertension increases the heart s workload, causing left ventricularhypertrophy and, later, left- and right-sided heart failure and pulmonaryedema.Diagnosis Serial blood pressure measurements are obtained and compared to previousreadings and trends to reveal an increase in diastolic and systolic pressures.(See Classifying blood pressure readings, page 32.)Classifying Blood Pressure Readings The Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) released updated guidelinesin 2014 for classifying and treating hypertension.The following categories are based on the average of two or morereadings taken on separate visits after an initial screening. They apply toadults 18 years old and older.Normal blood pressure with respect to cardiovascular risk is asystolic reading below 120 mm Hg and a diastolic reading below 80 mm Hg. Historically, hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressureof 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic pressure above 90 mm Hg. The",7,73
95,"latest guidelines, however, classify hypertension as a systolic reading of130 mm Hg or higher, or a diastolic pressure above 90 mm Hg.In addition to classifying stages of hypertension based on averageblood pressure readings, clinicians should also take note of target organdisease and any additional risk factors. Category Systolic (mm Hg) Diastolic (mm Hg)Normal 120 and 80Elevated 120 to 129 and 80Hypertension Stage 1 130 to 139 or 80 to 89Stage 2 2140 or 290Hypertensive crisis 2180 and/or 2120Auscultation may reveal bruits over the abdominal aorta and the carotid,renal, and femoral arteries; ophthalmoscopy reveals arteriovenous nickingand, in hypertensive encephalopathy, papilledema. Patient history and thefollowing additional tests may show predisposing factors and help identifyan underlying cause such as renal disease: Urinalysis: Protein levels and red and white blood cell counts mayindicate glomerulonephritis. Excretory urography: Renal atrophy indicates chronic renal disease; onekidney more than 5/8 (1.5 cm) shorter than the other suggests unilateralrenal disease. Serum potassium: Levels less than 3.5 m Eq/L may indicate adrenaldysfunction (primary hyperaldosteronism). BUN and serum creatinine: BUN level that s normal or elevated to morethan 20 mg/d L and serum creatinine level that s normal or elevated tomore than 1.5 mg/d L suggest renal disease.Other tests help detect cardiovascular damage and other complications: ECG may show left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia.Chest X-ray may show cardiomegaly. Echocardiography may show left ventricular hypertrophy.Treatment",7,69
96,"The JNC8 recommends the following approach for treating primaryhypertension:First, help the patient start needed lifestyle modifications, includingweight reduction, moderation of alcohol intake, regular physical exercise,reduction in sodium intake, and smoking cessation.If the patient fails to achieve the desired blood pressure or makesignificant progress, continue lifestyle modifications and begin drugtherapy. Pharmacologic therapy should begin when blood pressure is 140/90 inpatients less than 60, and 150/90 in those 60 and older. Ifthe patient has comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus or chronickidney disease (CKD), the goal should be to achieve blood pressure lessthan 140/90 regardless of age. Innonblack patients without CKD, consider using a thiazide diuretic, anangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, an angiotensin receptorblocker (ARB), or a calcium channel blocker (CCB), alone or incombination. In black patients without CKD, consider using a thiazide diuretic or a CCB, alone or in combination. Inall patients with CKD, consider initiating an ACE or ARB, alone or incombination with another class. If the patient has one or more compelling indications, base drug treatmenton benefits from outcome studies or existing clinical guidelines. Treatmentmay include the following, depending on indication:Heart failure ACE/ARB beta-adrenergic blocker (BB) diuretic spironolactone CAD ACE, BB, diuretic, CCBDiabetes ACE/ARB, CCB, diuretic CKD ACE inhibitor or ARBPostmyocardial infarction/clinical CAD ACE/ARB BBRecurrent stroke prevention ACE, diuretic Pregnancy labetalol (first line), nifedipine, methyldopa Give other antihypertensive drugs as needed. Ifthe patient fails to achieve the desired blood pressure, continue lifestylemodifications and optimize drug dosages or add drugs until the goal blood",9,90
97,"pressure is achieved. Also, consider consultation with a hypertensionspecialist.Treatment of secondary hypertension focuses on correcting the underlyingcause and controlling hypertensive effects.Typically, hypertensive emergencies require parenteral administration of avasodilator or an adrenergic inhibitor. Oral administration of a selected drug,such as nicardipine, hydralazine, or esmolol to rapidly reduces bloodpressure. The initial goal is to reduce mean arterial blood pressure by nomore than 25 (within minutes to hours) and then to 160/110 mm Hg within2 hours while avoiding excessive falls in blood pressure that can precipitaterenal, cerebral, or myocardial ischemia.Examples of hypertensive emergencies include hypertensiveencephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, acute left-sided heart failure withpulmonary edema, and dissecting aortic aneurysm. Hypertensive emergenciesare also associated with eclampsia or severe gestational hypertension,unstable angina, and acute MI.Hypertension without accompanying symptoms or target organ diseaseseldom requires emergency drug therapy.Special Considerations To encourage adherence to antihypertensive therapy, suggest that thepatient establish a daily routine for taking medication. Wam thatuncontrolled hypertension may cause stroke and heart attack. Tell thepatient to report adverse drug effects. Also, advise the patient to avoidhigh-sodium antacids and over-the-counter cold and sinus medications,which contain harmful vasoconstrictors. Encourage a change in dietary habits. Help the obese patient plan aweight-reduction diet; tell the patient to avoid high-sodium foods (pickles,potato chips, canned soups, and cold cuts) and table salt. Help the patient examine and modify lifestyle (e.g., by reducing stress andexercising regularly). Ifa patient is hospitalized with hypertension, find out if the patient wastaking his or her prescribed medication. If not, ask why. If the patient can tafford the medication, refer to appropriate social service agencies. Tellthe patient and family to keep a record of drugs used in the past, noting",15,103
98,"especially those that were or weren t effective. Suggest that the patientrecord this information on a card and show it to his or her practitioner.When routine blood pressure screening reveals elevated pressure, firstmake sure the cuff size is appropriate for the patient s upper armcircumference. Take the pressure in both arms in lying, sitting, andstanding positions. Ask the patient if he or she smoked, drank a beveragecontaining caffeine, or was emotionally upset before the test. Advise thepatient to retum for blood pressure testing at frequent and regularintervals.To help identify hypertension and prevent untreated hypertension,participate in public education programs dealing with hypertension andways to reduce risk factors. Encourage public participation in bloodpressure screening programs. Routinely screen all patients, especiallythose at risk (blacks and people with family histories of hypertension,stroke, or heart attack). (See Preventing hypertension, page 34.)PREVENTIONPREVENTING HYPERTENSIONCertain risk factors for hypertension can t be changed, such as familyhistory, race, and aging, but lifestyle modifications can help preventhypertension. Based on American Heart Association recommendations,advise your patient to do the following: Maintain A Healthy Weight Maintain a normal weight or lose weight if overweight. Weight losslowers blood pressure.Reduce Salt Salt intake should be reduced to about 1.5 g/day. Reducing salt intake canlower blood pressure in individuals with and without hypertension.Increase Potassium Patients should eat 8 to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables per day toincrease potassium intake. Potassium reduces blood pressure inindividuals with and without hypertension. Those with kidney disease or",14,90
99,"heart failure should contact their practitioner before increasing theirpotassium intake.Limit Alcohol Intake Studies have shown a correlation between alcohol intake and increasedblood pressure, especially in individuals who drink 2 drinks/day.Include Exercise Regular physical activity is defined by the American Heart Associationas moderate-intensity exercise such as brisk walking for 150 minuteseach week. A lack of physical activity can lead to obesity and increasethe risk of hypertension, heart attack, and stroke.Manage Stress Stress can lead to increased alcohol consumption, smoking, overeating,and other activities that increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. Dailyrelaxation for short periods during the workday and on weekends canalso lower blood pressure.Stop Smoking Smoking even filtered and light or ultra cigarettes can lead toatherosclerosis. Quitting or not starting is the only way to prevent thismajor risk factor for heart attack and stroke.Follow The Dash Diet The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet encouragesvegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy as well as whole grains, fish,poultry, and nuts. Discourage the eating of fats, red meat, sweets, andsugar-containing beverages. However, individuals with reduced kidneyfunction should always consult their practitioners before starting this diet;it s rich in potassium, which isn t recommended for individuals withthese disorders.CORONARY ARTERY DISEASECauses and Incidence",6,78
100,"CAD occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle hardenand narrow, usually as a result of atherosclerosis. The result is the loss ofoxygen and nutrients to myocardial tissue because of diminished coronaryblood flow. This reduction in blood flow can also lead to coronary syndrome(angina or MI). (See Understanding coronary artery disease.)Understanding Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) results as atherosclerotic plaque fills thelumens of the coronary arteries and obstructs blood flow. The primaryeffect of CAD is a diminished supply of oxygen and nutrients tomyocardial tissues.IRMAL FATTY STREAK FIBROUS PLAQUE COMPLICATEDCORONARY PLAQUEARTERYf F Tunica media Y hi fy Ny K j Tunica intima m S f hi Lumen 4 Q ; CAD has been linked to many risk factors: family history, male gender, age(risk increased in those 65 years old or older), hypertension, obesity,smoking, diabetes mellitus, stress, sedentary lifestyle, high serum cholesterol(particularly high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) or triglyceride levels,low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, high blood homocysteinelevels, menopause and, possibly, infections producing inflammatoryresponses in the artery walls.Uncommon causes of reduced coronary artery blood flow includedissecting aneurysms, infectious vasculitis, syphilis, and congenital defectsin the coronary vascular system. Coronary artery spasms may also impedeblood flow. (See Coronary artery spasm, page 36.)",8,67
101,"Coronary Artery Spasm In coronary artery spasm, a spontaneous, sustained contraction of one ormore coronary arteries causes ischemia and dysfunction of the heartmuscle. This disorder also causes Prinzmetal angina and evenmyocardial infarction in patients with unoccluded coronary arteries. Itscause is unknown but possible contributing factors include: altered flow of calcium into the cellintimal hemorrhage into the medial layer of the blood vesselhyperventilationelevated catecholamine levelsfatty buildup in lumen Signs and Symptoms The major symptom of coronary artery spasm is angina. However, unlikeclassic angina, this pain often occurs spontaneously and may not berelated to physical exertion or emotional stress; it s also more severe,usually lasts longer, and may be cyclic, frequently recurring every day atthe same time. Such ischemic episodes may cause arrhythmias, alteredheart rate, lower blood pressure and, occasionally, fainting due todiminished cardiac output. Spasm in the left coronary artery may result inmitral insufficiency, producing a loud systolic murmur and, possibly,pulmonary edema, with dyspnea, crackles, hemoptysis, or sudden death.Treatment After diagnosis by coronary angiography and electrocardiography(ECG), the patient may receive calcium channel blockers (CCBs;verapamil, nifedipine, or diltiazem) to reduce coronary artery spasm andvascular resistance and nitrates (nitroglycerin or isosorbide dinitrate) torelieve chest pain.When caring for a patient with coronary artery spasm, explain allnecessary procedures and teach them how to take medications safely. For CCB therapy, monitor blood pressure, pulse rate, and ECG pattems todetect arrhythmias. In patients receiving nifedipine and verapamil alongwith digoxin, monitor digoxin levels and check for signs of digoxin",8,92
102,"toxicity. Because nifedipine may cause peripheral and periorbital edema,watch for fluid retention.Because coronary artery spasm is commonly associated withatherosclerotic disease, advise the patient to stop smoking, avoidovereating, maintain a low-fat diet, use alcohol sparingly, and maintain abalance between exercise and rest.CAD is the leading cause of death in the United States. According to the American Heart Association, 1 in 3 deaths is due to cardiovascular disease,and someone dies from such an event about every 40 seconds.Pathophysiology In atherosclerosis, a form of arteriosclerosis, fatty, fibrous plaques, possiblyincluding calcium deposits, narrow the lumen of the coronary arteries andreduce the volume of blood that can flow through them, and leading tomyocardial ischemia. Plaque formation also predisposes to thrombosis,which can provoke MI.Atherosclerosis usually develops in high-flow, high-pressure arteries,such as those in the heart, brain, kidneys, and in the aorta, especially atbifurcation points.Signs and Symptoms The classic symptom of CAD is angina, the direct result of inadequateoxygen flow to the myocardium. Anginal pain is usually described as abuming, squeezing, or tight feeling in the substemal or precordial chest thatmay radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw, or shoulder blade. Typically, thepatient clenches a fist over his chest or rubs the left arm when describing thepain, which may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fainting, sweating, andcool extremities. Anginal episodes most often follow physical exertion butmay also follow emotional excitement, exposure to cold, or a large meal.Some patients, particularly those with diabetes, may not experience typicalanginal pain but may have dyspnea, fatigue, diaphoresis, or more vaguesymptoms.Angina has four major forms: stable (pain is predictable in frequency andduration and can be relieved with nitrates and rest), unstable (pain increasesin frequency and duration and is more easily induced), Prinzmetal or variant",7,106
103,"(from unpredictable coronary artery spasm), and microvascular (in whichimpairment of vasodilator reserve causes angina-like chest pain in a patientwith normal coronary arteries). Severe and prolonged anginal pain generallysuggests MI, with potentially fatal arrhythmias and mechanical failure.Diagnosis The patient history including the frequency and duration of angina and thepresence of associated risk factors is crucial in evaluating CAD.Additional diagnostic measures include the following: Electrocardiogram (ECG) during angina may show ischemia and,possibly, arrhythmias such as premature ventricular contractions. ECG isapt to be normal when the patient is pain-free. Arrhythmias may occurwithout infarction, secondary to ischemia. Treadmill or exercise stress test may provoke chest pain and ECG signsof myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography reveals coronary artery stenosis or obstruction,possible collateral circulation, and the arteries condition beyond thenarrowing.Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium-201, Cardiolite, or Myoviewduring treadmill exercise detects ischemic areas of the myocardium,visualized as cold spots. Stress echocardiography may show wall motion abnormalities. Electron-beam computed tomography identifies calcium within arterialplaque; the more calcium seen, the higher the likelihood of CAD.Treatment The goal of treatment in patients with angina is to either reduce myocardialoxygen demand or increase oxygen supply. Therapy consists primarily ofnitrates such as nitroglycerin (given sublingually, orally, transdermally, ortopically in ointment form) to dilate coronary arteries and improve bloodsupply to the heart. Glycoprotein IIb to IIa inhibitors and antithrombin drugsmay be used to reduce the risk of blood clots. BBs may be used to decreaseheart rate and lower the heart s oxygen use. CCBs may be used to relax thecoronary arteries and all systemic arteries, reducing the heart s workload.ACE inhibitors, diuretics, or other medications may be used to lower bloodpressure.",12,107
104,"Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) may beperformed during cardiac catheterization to compress fatty deposits andrelieve occlusion in patients with no calcification and partial occlusion.PTCA carries a certain risk, but the morbidity associated with it is lowerthan that for surgery. (See Relieving occlusions with angioplasty, pages 38and 39.)Relieving Occlusions With Angioplasty Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can open an occludedcoronary artery without opening the chest an important advantage overbypass surgery. First, coronary angiography must confirm the presenceand location of the arterial occlusion. Then, the physician threads a guidecatheter through the patient s femoral or radial artery into the coronaryartery under fluoroscopic guidance, as shown at right.When angiography shows the guide catheter positioned at the occlusionsite, the physician carefully inserts a smaller double-lumen ballooncatheter through the guide catheter and directs the balloon through theocclusion (opposite page, left). A marked pressure gradient will beobvious.The physician altemately inflates and deflates the balloon until anangiogram verifies successful arterial dilation (opposite page, right) andthe pressure gradient has decreased.",6,61

However, patients who have a left main coronaryartery occlusion, lesions in extremely tortuous vessels, or occlusions olderthan 3 months aren t candidates for PTCA.PTCA can be done along with coronary stenting, or stents may be placedalone. Stents provide a framework to hold an artery open by securing theflaps of the tunica media against an artery wall. Intravascular coronary arterystenting is done to reduce the incidence of restenosis. Prosthetic cylindricalstents made of stainless steel coil are positioned at the site of occlusion.Drug-eluting stents have proven to be safe and effective and have a lowerrate of restenosis when compared with bare-metal stents.Laser angioplasty corrects occlusion by vaporizing fatty deposits with theexcimer, or hot-tipped laser device. Percutaneous myocardial",6,45
107,"revascularization uses a laser to create channels in the heart muscle toimprove perfusion to the myocardium. A carbon dioxide laser is used tocreate transmural channels from the epicardium to the myocardium, extendinginto the left ventricle. This technique is also known as transmyocardialrevascularization and appears to be effective for severe symptoms. Inaddition, a stent may be placed in the artery to act as a scaffold to hold theartery open. Obstructive lesions may necessitate coronary artery bypass graft(CABG) surgery and the use of vein grafts.A surgical technique available as an altemative to traditional CABGsurgery is minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery, also known aslaparoscopic surgery. This procedure requires a shorter recovery period andhas fewer postoperative complications. Instead of sawing open the patient sstemum and spreading the ribs apart, several small cuts are made in the torsothrough which small surgical instruments and fiber-optic cameras areinserted. This procedure was initially designed to correct blockages in justone or two easily reached arteries; it may not be suitable for morecomplicated cases.Coronary brachytherapy, which involves delivering beta or gammaradiation into the coronary arteries, may be used in patients who veundergone stent implantation in a coronary artery but then developed suchproblems as diffuse in-stent restenosis. Brachytherapy is a promisingtechnique, but its use is restricted to the treatment of stent-related problemsbecause of complications and the unknown long-term effects of the radiation.However, in some facilities, brachytherapy is being studied as a first-linetreatment of CAD.BESEEa S PREVENTION Because CAD is so widespread, prevention is of greatimportance. Encourage dietary restrictions aimed at reducing intake ofcalories (in obesity) and salt, saturated fats, and cholesterol, in order tominimize the risk, especially when supplemented with regular exercise.Also, encourage the patient to stop smoking and to reduce stress. Otherpreventive actions to encourage include control of hypertension, control ofelevated serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels (with antilipemics), andmeasures to minimize platelet aggregation and the danger of blood clots(with aspirin or other antiplatelet drugs).Special Considerations",11,106
108,"During anginal episodes, monitor blood pressure and heart rate. Take an ECG during anginal episodes and before administering nitroglycerin orother nitrates. Record duration of pain, amount of medication required torelieve it, and accompanying symptoms.Keep nitroglycerin available for immediate use. Instruct the patient to callimmediately whenever feeling chest, arm, or neck pain. Before cardiac catheterization, explain the procedure to the patient. Makesure the patient knows why it s necessary, understands the risks, andrealizes that it may indicate a need for surgery. After catheterization, review the expected course of treatment with thepatient and family. Monitor the catheter site for bleeding. Also, check fordistal pulses. To counter the dye s diuretic effect, make sure the patientdrinks plenty of fluids. Assess potassium levels.If the patient is scheduled for surgery, explain the procedure to the patientand family. Give them a tour of the ICU and introduce them to the staff. After surgery, monitor blood pressure, intake and output, breath sounds,chest tube drainage, and ECG, watching for signs of ischemia andarrhythmias. Also, observe for and treat chest pain and possible dyereactions. Give vigorous chest physiotherapy and guide the patient inremoval of secretions through deep breathing, coughing, and expectorationof mucus. Before discharge, stress the need to follow the prescribed drug regimen(e.g., antihypertensives, nitrates, and antilipemics), exercise program, anddiet. Encourage regular, moderate exercise. Refer the patient to a self-helpprogram to stop smoking.MYOCARDIAL INFARCTIONCauses and Incidence MI, commonly known as a heart attack and part of a broader category ofdisease known as acute coronary syndrome, results from prolongedmyocardial ischemia due to reduced blood flow through one of the coronaryarteries.

113,"Pathophysiology The site of the MI depends on the vessels involved. Occlusion of thecircumflex branch of the left coronary artery causes a lateral wall infarction;occlusion of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery, ananterior wall infarction. True posterior or inferior wall infarctions generallyresult from occlusion of the right coronary artery or one of its branches. Rightventricular infarctions can also result from right coronary artery occlusion,can accompany inferior infarctions, and may cause right-sided heart failure.Signs and Symptoms The cardinal symptom of MI is persistent, crushing substemal pain that mayradiate to the left arm, jaw, neck, or shoulder blades. Such pain is usuallydescribed as heavy, squeezing, or crushing, and may persist for 12 hours ormore. However, in some MI patients particularly elderly people or thosewith diabetes pain may not occur at all; in others, it may be mild andconfused with indigestion. In patients with CAD, angina of increasingfrequency, severity, or duration (especially if not provoked by exertion, aheavy meal, or cold and wind) may signal impending infarction.Other clinical effects include a feeling of impending doom, fatigue, nausea,vomiting, and shortness of breath. Some patients may have no symptoms. Thepatient may experience catecholamine responses, such as coolness inextremities, perspiration, anxiety, and restlessness. Fever is unusual at theonset of an MI, but a low-grade temperature elevation may develop duringthe next few days. Blood pressure varies; hypotension or hypertension maybe present.The most common post-MI complications include recurrent or persistentchest pain, arrhythmias, left-sided heart failure (resulting in heart failure oracute pulmonary edema), and cardiogenic shock. Unusual but potentiallylethal complications that may develop soon after infarction includethromboembolism; papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture, causing mitralinsufficiency; rupture of the ventricular septum, causing VSD; rupture of themyocardium; and ventricular aneurysm. Up to several months after infarction,Dressler syndrome (pericarditis, pericardial friction rub, chest pain, fever,leukocytosis and, possibly, pleurisy or pneumonitis) may develop.Diagnosis",13,114
114,"By CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Persistent chest pain, elevated ST segment on ECG, and elevated total CK and CK-MB levels over a 72-hour periodare consistent with ST-elevation MI (STEMI). Troponin T or troponin I isalso used in the diagnosis because both are specific to cardiac necrosis,and levels rise 6 to 8 hours after onset of ischemia. These labs are alsouseful when no ST-segment elevation occurs, as in non ST elevation MI(NSTEMD).Auscultation may reveal diminished heart sounds, gallops, and, inpapillary dysfunction, the apical systolic murmur of mitral insufficiency overthe mitral valve area.When clinical features are equivocal, assume that the patient had an MIuntil tests rule it out. Diagnostic laboratory results include: serial 12-lead ECG ECG abnormalities may be absent or inconclusiveduring the first few hours after an MI. When present, characteristicabnormalities include serial ST-segment depression NSTEMI and STEMI.serial serum enzyme levels CK levels are elevated, specifically, the CK-MB isoenzyme. echocardiography amay show ventricular wall motion abnormalities. nuclear ventriculography scans (MUGA or radionuclide ventriculography) using I. V. radioactive substance, can identify acutely damaged muscleby picking up radioactive nucleotide, which appears as a hot spot on thefilm; useful in localizing a recent MI.Treatment The goals of treatment are to relieve chest pain, stabilize heart rhythm,reduce cardiac workload, revascularize the coronary artery, and preservemyocardial tissue. Arrhythmias, the predominant problem during the first 48hours after the infarction, may require antiarrhythmics, possibly a pacemaker,and, rarely, cardioversion. Arrhythmias are best detected using a 12-lead ECG.To preserve myocardial tissue is primary percutaneous coronaryintervention (PCI) (mechanical reperfusion). PCI has been shown in manystudies to be superior to fibrinolysis in the combined end points of death,stroke, and reinfarction when it is performed within 90 minutes of patientarrival. When primary PCI cannot be performed within 90 minutes,",11,96
115,"thrombolysis is the treatment of choice in STEMI. (See Comparingthrombolytics, page 43.)Comparing Thrombolytics If your patient has suffered a myocardial infarction (MI), you mustintervene promptly to minimize cardiac damage and avert death. Ifappropriate, prepare the patient for thrombolytic therapy as ordered.Thrombolytic drugs enhance the body s natural ability to dispose ofblood clots. To lyse (dissolve) fibrin, the essential component of a clot,tissue activators convert plasminogen to plasmin. A nonspecific protease,plasmin, degrades fibrin, fibrinogen, and procoagulant factors (such asfactors V, VII, and XID.Candidates for thrombolytic therapy include patients with acute ST-segment elevation and chest pain that has lasted no more than 6 hours andwho have no access to cardiac catheterization. Timely use ofthrombolytic agents can restore myocardial perfusion and prevent furtherinjury. When effective, thrombolytic agents relieve chest pain, restore the ST segment to baseline, and induce reperfusion arrhythmias within 30 to45 minutes.Contraindications to thrombolytic therapy include surgery within thepast 2 months, active bleeding, a history of stroke, intracranial neoplasm,arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, or uncontrolled hypertension.Here s how selected thrombolytics open occluded coronary arteries inpatients with an acute MI.Alteplase (Activase)This naturally occurring enzyme has been cloned and produced as a drug,alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator). Binding to plasminogen, itcatalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin in the presence offibrin. Because of its strong affinity for fibrin, alteplase concentrates atthe clot site, resulting in a minimal decrease in the fibrinogen level.This thrombolytic has a half-life of 5 minutes, so maintaining coronaryartery patency depends on continued anticoagulation with heparin.Alteplase doesn t induce antigenic responses; doses may be repeated atany time.",10,107
116,"Reteplase (Retavase)Reteplase, recombinant plasminogen activator, has a half-life of 13 to 16minutes. Its longer half-life allows it to be administered as a bolus. Twoboluses are required.Streptokinase (Streptase)Streptokinase, a thrombolytic, is a bacterial protein that binds tocirculating plasminogen and catalyzes plasmin formation. Its lowspecificity for fibrin induces a systemic lytic state and increases the riskof bleeding.The half-life is 20 minutes. Like anistreplase, streptokinase isantigenic.Tenecteplase (Tnkase)Tenecteplase is a modified form of human tissue plasminogen activatorthat binds to fibrin and converts plasminogen to plasmin. It s given as asingle bolus dose.Urokinase (Abbokinase)Naturally produced by the human kidney, urokinase promotesthrombolysis by directly activating the conversion of plasminogen toplasmin.With a serum half-life of 10 to 20 minutes, urokinase is rapidly clearedby the kidneys and liver. Unlike streptokinase, it doesn t induce anantigenic response. Urokinase isn t given through a peripheral IV. line totreat an acute MI, but patients who undergo cardiac catheterizationmay receive it directly in a coronary artery.Other treatments consist of: lidocaine, vasopressin, or amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias, orother drugs, such as procainamide, quinidine, or disopyramide antiplatelet therapy with glycoprotein IIb to Ila inhibitors, such asclopidogrel for non-STEMI atropine I.V. or a temporary pacemaker for heart block or bradycardia nitroglycerin (sublingual, topical, transdermal, or I.V.); CCBs, such asnifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem (sublingual, oral, or I.V.); or",12,87

Most MI patients receive treatmentin the ICU or on a telemetry unit, where they re under constant observationfor complications. On admission, monitor and record the patient s ECG, blood pressure,temperature, and heart and breath sounds. Assess and record the severity and duration of pain, and administeranalgesics. Avoid I.M. injections; absorption from the muscle isunpredictable, and bleeding is likely if the patient is receivingthrombolytic therapy.Check the patient s blood pressure after giving nitroglycerin, especiallythe first dose. Frequently monitor the ECG to detect rate changes or arrhythmias. Placerhythm strips in the patient s chart periodically for evaluation.",11,105

Auscultate for adventitious breathsounds periodically (patients on bed rest frequently have atelectaticcrackles, which disappear after coughing), for S, or S, gallops, and fomew-onset heart murmurs. Organize patient care and activities to maximize periods of uninterruptedrest.Initiate a cardiac rehabilitation program. This usually includes educationregarding heart disease, exercise, and emotional support for the patientand family. Ask the dietary department to provide a clear liquid diet until nauseasubsides. A low-cholesterol, low-sodium, low-fat, high-fiber diet may beprescribed. Provide a stool softener to prevent straining during defecation, becausethis causes vagal stimulation and may slow the heart rate. Allow use of abedside commode and provide as much privacy as possible. Assist with range-of-motion exercises. If the patient is completelyimmobilized by a severe MI, tum often. Antiembolism stockings helpprevent venostasis and thrombophlebitis. Provide emotional support and help reduce stress and anxiety. Explainprocedures and answer questions.

Congestion of systemicvenous circulation may result in peripheral edema or hepatomegaly;congestion of pulmonary circulation may cause pulmonary edema, an acutelife-threatening emergency. Pump failure usually occurs in a damaged leftventricle (left-sided heart failure) but may occur in the right ventricle (right-sided heart failure) either as a primary disorder or secondary to left-sidedheart failure. Sometimes, left- and right-sided heart failure developsimultaneously. (See What happens in heart failure, pages 44 and 45.)PATHOPHYSIOLOGYWHAT HAPPENS IN HEART FAILURE",13,86
120,"Heart failure occurs when cardiac output is inadequate to meetthe body s needs. The pathophysiology of heart failure is shownin the flow chart below. Heart failure may result from a primary abnormality of the heart musclesuch as an infarction, inadequate myocardial perfusion due to CAD, orcardiomyopathy. Other causes include: diastolic dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction, impairment ofventricular filling by diminished relaxation or reduced compliance seenwith hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial hypertrophy, andpericardial restriction mechanical disturbances in ventricular filling during diastole when there stoo little blood for the ventricle to pump, as in mitral stenosis secondaryto rheumatic heart disease or constrictive pericarditis and atrialfibrillation systolic hemodynamic disturbances, such as excessive cardiac workloaddue to volume overload or pressure overload that limit the heart spumping ability. These disturbances can result from mitral or aorticinsufficiency, which causes volume overloading, and aortic stenosis orsystemic hypertension, which result in increased resistance to ventricularemptying.",5,50
121,"Heart failure affects 5.7 million people in the United States. It becomesmore common with advancing age. Although heart failure may be acute (as adirect result of MI), it s generally a chronic disorder associated with sodiumand water retention by the kidneys. Advances in diagnostic and therapeutictechniques have greatly improved the outlook for patients with heart failure,but the prognosis still depends on the underlying cause and its response totreatment. Fifty percent will diet within 5 years of diagnosis.Pathophysiology Reduced cardiac output triggers compensatory mechanisms, such asventricular dilation, hypertrophy, increased sympathetic activity, andactivation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system. These mechanismsimprove cardiac output at the expense of increased ventricular work. Incardiac dilation, an increase in end-diastolic ventricular volume (preload)causes increased stroke work and stroke volume during contraction,stretching cardiac muscle fibers beyond optimum limits and producingpulmonary congestion and pulmonary hypertension, which in tum lead toright-sided heart failure.In ventricular hypertrophy, an increase in muscle mass or diameter of theleft ventricle allows the heart to pump against increased resistance(impedance) to the outflow of blood. An increase in ventricular diastolicpressure necessary to fill the enlarged ventricle may compromise diastoliccoronary blood flow, limiting oxygen supply to the ventricle and causingischemia and impaired muscle contractility.Increased sympathetic activity occurs as a response to decreased cardiacoutput and blood pressure by enhancing PVR, contractility, heart rate, andvenous retum. Signs of increased sympathetic activity, such as coolextremities and clamminess, may indicate impending heart failure. Increasedsympathetic activity also restricts blood flow to the kidneys, which respondby reducing the glomerular filtration rate and increasing tubular reabsorptionof salt and water, in tum expanding the circulating blood volume. This renalmechanism, if unchecked, can aggravate congestion and produce overtedema.Chronic heart failure may worsen as a result of respiratory tract infections,pulmonary embolism, stress, increased sodium or water intake, or failure toadhere to the prescribed treatment regimen.",11,117
122,"Complications Pulmonary edema Multiorgan failure Myocardial infarction Signs and Symptoms Left-sided heart failure primarily produces pulmonary signs and symptoms;right-sided heart failure, primarily systemic signs and symptoms. However,heart failure often affects both sides of the heart.Clinical signs of left-sided heart failure include dyspnea, orthopnea,crackles, possibly wheezing, hypoxia, respiratory acidosis, cough, cyanosisor pallor, palpitations, arrhythmias, elevated blood pressure, and pulsusaltemans.Clinical signs of right-sided heart failure include dependent peripheraledema, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, JVD, ascites, slow weight gain,arrhythmias, positive hepatojugular reflex, abdominal distention, nausea,vomiting, anorexia, weakness, fatigue, dizziness, and syncope.Vv ALERT Excessive fluid can accumulate in the pericardium, requiringremoval through pericardiocentesis.Diagnosis ECG may reflect heart strain or enlargement, ischemia, or old MI. It mayalso reveal atrial enlargement, tachycardia, and extrasystoles. Chest X-ray shows increased pulmonary vascular markings, interstitialedema, or pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. PAP monitoring typically demonstrates elevated pulmonary artery and PAWPs elevated; left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in left-sided heartfailure; and elevated right atrial pressure or CVP in right-sided heartfailure. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a neurohormone producedpredominantly by the ventricles and released in response to blood volumeexpansion or pressure overload. Blood concentrations greater than 100pg/m L can be an accurate predictor of acute heart failure.Echocardiogram may demonstrate wall motion abnormalities and chamberdilation.",7,97
123,"Other tests that may also demonstrate enlargement of the heart ordecreased functioning include chest computed tomography scan, cardiac MRI, or nuclear scans, such as MUGA and radionuclide ventriculography.Treatment The goal of therapy is to improve pump function by reversing thecompensatory mechanisms producing the clinical effects, underlyingdisorders, and precipitating factors. Heart failure can be quickly controlledby treatment consisting of: ACE inhibitors to decrease PVR antiembolism stockings to reduce the risk of venostasis andthromboembolus formation bed rest for acute heart failure carvedilol, a nonselective BB with alpha-receptor blockade to reducemortality and improve quality of life digoxin or dopamine to strengthen myocardial contractility diuresis to reduce total blood volume and circulatory congestion inotropic agents, such as dobutamine and milrinone, given I. V. to improvethe heart s ability to pump nesiritide, a recombinant form of endogenous human BNP, to reducesodium through its diuretic action vasodilators to increase cardiac output by reducing the impedance toventricular outflow (afterload).Excess fluid can be removed through dialysis if necessary. Circulatoryassistance can be provided by implanted devices, such as the IABP and theleft ventricular assist device (LVAD), but they re only temporary solutions.A LVAD may be an option for those with refractory heart failure who arenot eligible for transplant. This procedure may increase the patient s qualityof life.Watch for and treat complications, which typically may include pulmonaryedema (See Pulmonary edema: How to intervene, pages 48 and 49);venostasis, with predisposition to thromboembolism (associated primarilywith prolonged bed rest); cerebral insufficiency; and renal insufficiency, withsevere electrolyte imbalance.",4,92

It is the most common type of cardiomyopathy. This disorderinterferes with myocardial metabolism and grossly dilates all four chambers",11,95
126,"of the heart, giving the heart a globular appearance and shape. In thisdisorder, hypertrophy may be present. Dilated cardiomyopathy leads tointractable heart failure, arrhythmias, and emboli. Because this disease isn tusually diagnosed until it s in the advanced stages, the patient s prognosis isgenerally poor.The cause of most cardiomyopathies is unknown. Occasionally, dilatedcardiomyopathy results from myocardial destruction by toxic, infectious, ormetabolic agents, such as certain viruses, endocrine and electrolytedisorders, nutritional deficiencies, and certain cardiotoxic anticancer drugs(e.g., doxorubicin). Other causes include muscle disorders (myastheniagravis, progressive muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy), infiltrativedisorders (hemochromatosis and amyloidosis), and sarcoidosis.Cardiomyopathy may also be a complication of alcoholism. In such cases,it may improve with abstinence from alcohol but recurs when the patientresumes drinking.Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in 1 in 2,500 people and affects all agesand both sexes. It s most common in adult men between the ages of 30 and40.Pathophysiology How viruses induce cardiomyopathy is unclear, but researchers suspect alink between viral myocarditis and subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy,especially after infection with poliovirus, coxsackievirus B, influenza virus,or human immunodeficiency virus.Metabolic cardiomyopathies are related to endocrine and electrolytedisorders and nutritional deficiencies. Thus, dilated cardiomyopathy maydevelop in patients with hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, beriberi(thiamine deficiency), or kwashiorkor (protein deficiency). Cardiomyopathymay also result from rheumatic fever, especially among children withmyocarditis.Antepartal or postpartal cardiomyopathy may develop during the lasttrimester or within months after delivery. Its cause is unknown, but it occursmost frequently in multiparous women older than 30, particularly those withmalnutrition or preeclampsia. In these patients, cardiomegaly and heartfailure may reverse with treatment, allowing a subsequent normal pregnancy.If cardiomegaly persists despite treatment, the prognosis is poor.",12,102
127,"Complications Heart failure Arrhythmias Emboli Ventricular arrhythmias Syncope Sudden death Signs and Symptoms In dilated cardiomyopathy, the heart ejects blood less efficiently than normal.Consequently, a large volume of blood remains in the left ventricle aftersystole, causing signs of heart failure both left-sided (shortness of breath,orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal noctumal dyspnea, fatigue, andan irritating dry cough at night) and right-sided (edema, liver engorgement,and JVD). Dilated cardiomyopathy also produces peripheral cyanosis andsinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation at rest in some patients secondary tolow cardiac output. Auscultation reveals diffuse apical impulses, pansystolicmurmur (mitral and tricuspid insufficiency secondary to cardiomegaly andweak papillary muscles), and S, and S, gallop rhythms.Diagnosis Diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy requires elimination of other possiblecauses of heart failure and arrhythmias. ECG and angiography rule out ischemic heart disease; ECG may alsoshow biventricular hypertrophy, sinus tachycardia, atrial enlargement,and, in 20 of patients, atrial fibrillation and bundle branch block.Chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly usually affecting all heart chambers and may demonstrate pulmonary congestion, pleural or pericardialeffusion, or pulmonary venous hypertension.Chest computed tomography scan or echocardiography identifies leftventricular thrombi, global hypokinesia, and degree of left ventriculardilation. Nuclear heart scans, such as MUGA and ventriculography, show heartenlargement, lung congestion, heart failure, and decreased movement orfunctioning of the heart.",5,86
128,"Treatment Therapeutic goals include correcting the underlying causes and improving theheart s pumping ability with digoxin, diuretics, oxygen, and a sodium-restricted diet. Other options include an ACE inhibitor or ARB, a beta-blocker, aspirin, and, potentially, other blood-thinning medications.Vasodilators reduce preload and afterload, thereby decreasing congestionand increasing cardiac output. Acute heart failure requires vasodilation withnitroprusside or nitroglycerin I.V.When these treatments fail, therapy may require pacemakers, implantablecardiac defibrillations, LVADs, or, as a last resort, a heart transplant forcarefully selected patients.Special Considerations In the patient with acute failure: Monitor for signs of progressive failure (increasing crackles and dyspneaand increased JVD) and compromised renal perfusion (oliguria, elevated BUN and creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances). Weigh the patientdaily.If the patient is receiving vasodilators, check blood pressure and heartrate. If the patient becomes hypotensive, stop the infusion and place inasupine position, with legs elevated to increase venous retum and to ensurecerebral blood flow.If the patient is receiving diuretics, monitor for signs of resolvingcongestion (decreased crackles and dyspnea) or too-vigorous diuresis.Check serum potassium level for hypokalemia, especially if therapyincludes digoxin.Therapeutic restrictions and an uncertain prognosis usually causeprofound anxiety and depression, so offer support and let the patientexpress his or her feelings. Be flexible with visiting hours.Before discharge, teach the patient about their illness and its treatment.Emphasize the need to avoid alcohol and smoking, to restrict sodiumintake, to watch for weight gain (a weight gain of 3 lb 1.4 kg over to 2days indicates fluid accumulation), and to take digoxin as prescribed,watching for its adverse effects (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and yellowvision). Encourage family members to leam cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).",7,115
129,"HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHYCauses and Incidence This primary disease of cardiac muscle, also called idiopathic hypertrophicsubaortic stenosis, is characterized by disproportionate, asymmetricalthickening of the interventricular septum, particularly in the left ventricle sfree wall. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac output may be low,normal, or high, depending on whether the stenosis is obstructive omonobstructive. If cardiac output is normal or high, the disorder may goundetected for years; but low cardiac output may lead to potentially fatalheart failure. The disease course varies; some patients progressivelydeteriorate; others remain stable for years. (See Looking at hypertrophiccardiomyopathy, pages 50 to 52.)Looking At Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy1. The left ventricle and interventricular septum hypertrophy andbecome stiff, noncompliant, and unable to relax during ventricularfilling.",7,39
130,"2. As the ventricle s ability to fill decreases, the pressure increases,and left atrial and pulmonary venous pressures rise. 3. The left ventricle forcefully contracts but can t sufficiently relax.",4,7
131,. The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is drawn toward theinterventricular septum as the blood is forcefully ejected. Earlyclosure of the outflow tract results because of the decreasingejection fraction.,3,11
132,"This disorder affects 1 in 500 people and is more common in men than inwomen and more so in blacks than in whites. It is also usually the cause ofsudden death, particularly in otherwise healthy athletes.Pathophysiology Despite being designated as idiopathic, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may beinherited as a non-sex-linked autosomal dominant trait in almost all cases.Most patients have obstructive disease, resulting from effects of ventricularseptal hypertrophy and the movement of the anterior mitral valve leaflet intothe outflow tract during systole. Eventually, left ventricular dysfunction, fromrigidity and decreased compliance, causes pump failure.Complications Pulmonary hypertension Heart failure Ventricular arrhythmias Sudden death",3,34
133,"Signs and Symptoms Clinical features of the disorder may not appear until it s well advanced,when atrial dilation and, possibly, atrial fibrillation abruptly reduce bloodflow to the left ventricle. Reduced inflow and subsequent low output mayproduce angina pectoris, arrhythmias, dyspnea, orthopnea, syncope, heartfailure, and death. Auscultation reveals a medium-pitched systolic ejectionmurmur along the left stemal border and at the apex; palpation reveals aperipheral pulse with a characteristic double impulse (pulsus bisferiens)and, with atrial fibrillation, an irregular pulse.Diagnosis Diagnosis depends on typical clinical findings and these test results: Echocardiography (most useful) shows increased thickness of theintraventricular septum and abnormal motion of the anterior mitral leafletduring systole, occluding left ventricular outflow in obstructive disease. Cardiac catheterization reveals elevated left ventricular end-diastolicpressure and, possibly, mitral insufficiency. ECG usually shows left ventricular hypertrophy, T-wave inversion, leftanterior hemiblock, Q waves in precordial and inferior leads, ventriculararrhythmias, and, possibly, atrial fibrillation. Auscultation confirms an early systolic murmur.Treatment The goals of treatment are to relax the ventricle and to relieve outflow tractobstruction. Agents such as metoprolol, a BB, slow heart rate and increaseventricular filling by relaxing the obstructing muscle, thereby reducingangina, syncope, dyspnea, and arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation necessitatescardioversion to treat the arrhythmia and, because of the high risk of systemicembolism, anticoagulant therapy until fibrillation subsides. Becausevasodilators such as nitroglycerin reduce venous retum by permitting poolingof blood in the periphery, decreasing ventricular volume and chamber size,and may cause further obstruction, they re contraindicated in patients withhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Also contraindicated are ACE inhibitors and ARBs because they can also worsen the obstruction. Disopyramide ispreferred because of its negative inotropic properties. Patients with",12,107
134,"potentially lethal arrhythmias may need an implantable cardioverter defibrillator to prevent sudden death.If drug therapy fails, surgery is indicated. Septal myectomy reduces thethickness of the septum through removal of a portion of the proximal septum.This can be performed alone or in combination with mitral valvereplacement, which may ease outflow tract obstruction and relievesymptoms. However, complications, such as complete heart block and VSD,can occur, requiring pacemaker implantation.Special Considerations Because syncope or sudden death may follow well-tolerated exercise,wam such patients against strenuous physical activity such as running. Administer medications as prescribed. Caution: Avoid nitroglycerin,digoxin, and diuretics because they can worsen obstruction. Wam thepatient not to stop taking their beta-blocker abruptly, because doing somay increase myocardial demands. To determine the patient s tolerancefor an increased dosage of the beta-blocker, take his or her pulse to checkfor bradycardia. Also take a blood pressure reading while the patient issupine and while standing (a drop in blood pressure 10 mm Hg whenstanding may indicate orthostatic hypotension).Before dental work or surgery, tell the patient to discuss prophylaxis forsubacute infective endocarditis with his or her healthcare provider.Provide psychological support. If the patient is hospitalized for a longtime, be flexible with visiting hours and encourage occasional weekendsaway from the hospital, if possible. Refer the patient for psychosocialcounseling to help the patient and family accept restricted lifestyle andpoor prognosis.If the patient is a child, have the parents arrange for them to continueschool work or studies in the healthcare facility.Because sudden cardiac arrest is possible, urge the patient s family toleam cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Cardiac Complications HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK",11,90
135,"Causes and Incidence In hypovolemic shock, reduced intravascular blood volume causescirculatory dysfunction and inadequate tissue perfusion. Without sufficientblood or fluid replacement, hypovolemic shock syndrome may lead toirreversible cerebral and renal damage, cardiac arrest, and, ultimately, death.Hypovolemic shock requires early recognition of signs and symptoms andprompt, aggressive treatment to improve the prognosis. (See What happensin hypovolemic shock, page 55.)PATHOPHYSIOLOGYWHAT HAPPENS IN HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCKIn hypovolemic shock, vascular fluid volume loss causes extremetissue hypoperfusion. Intemal fluid losses can result from hemorrhage orthird-space fluid shifting. Extemal fluid loss can result from severebleeding or from severe diarrhea, diuresis, or vomiting. Inadequatevascular volume leads to decreased venous retum and cardiac output.The resulting drop in arterial blood pressure activates the body scompensatory mechanisms in an attempt to increase vascular volume. Ifcompensation is unsuccessful, decompensation and death may occur.",8,53
136,"Intemal or extemal fluid loss Decreased intravascular fluid volume Diminished venous retum Reduced preload (filling pressure)Decreased stroke volume Lowered cardiac output Reduced mean arterial blood pressure Decreased tissue perfusion Reduced oxygen and nutrient delivery to cells Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome Hypovolemic shock usually results from acute blood loss about one fifthof total volume. Such massive blood loss may result from GI bleeding,intemal hemorrhage (hemothorax and hemoperitoneum), extemal hemorrhage(accidental or surgical trauma), or from any condition that reducescirculating intravascular plasma volume or other body fluids such as in",2,36
137,"severe bums. Other underlying causes of hypovolemic shock includeintestinal obstruction, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, ascites and dehydrationfrom excessive perspiration, severe diarrhea or protracted vomiting,diabetes insipidus, diuresis, or inadequate fluid intake.Pathophysiology Hypovolemic shock occurs when there is not enough intravascular volume tomaintain tissue perfusion. At first, the body responds by stimulating thirst andreducing the amount of fluid filtered through the kidneys. Additionally, heartrate becomes elevated to increase cardiac output, contractility increases tomaintain stroke volume, and increased systemic vascular resistance shuntsblood away from the periphery and toward the heart and central nervoussystem. Hypotension is a late sign since blood pressure can be maintainedinitially through compensatory vasoconstriction, which decreases tissueperfusion. Cardiac arrest may occur soon after.Complications Acute respiratory distress syndrome Acute tubular necrosis Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Multiple-organ-dysfunction syndrome Signs and Symptoms Hypovolemic shock produces a syndrome of hypotension, with narrowingpulse pressure; decreased sensorium; tachycardia; rapid, shallowrespirations; reduced urine output ( 25 m L/hour); and cold, pale, clammyskin. Metabolic acidosis with an accumulation of lactic acid develops as aresult of tissue anoxia, as cellular metabolism shifts from aerobic toanaerobic pathways. DIC is a possible complication of hypovolemic shock.Diagnosis No single symptom or diagnostic test establishes the diagnosis or severity ofshock.

138,"decreased blood p H and partial pressure of arterial oxygen and increasedpartial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide.In addition, gastroscopy, aspiration of gastric contents through anasogastric (NG) tube, computed tomography scan, and X-rays identifyintemal bleeding sites; coagulation studies may detect coagulopathy from DIC. Echocardiography or right heart catheterization can help differentiatebetween hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock.Treatment Emergency treatment measures must include prompt and adequate blood andfluid replacement to restore intravascular volume and raise blood pressure.Saline solution or lactated Ringer solution, then possibly plasma proteins(albumin) or other plasma expanders, may produce adequate volumeexpansion until whole blood can be matched. A rapid solution infusionsystem of 1 to 2 L of isotonic crystalloids can be used and continued ifhypotension persists. Measuring CVP can assist in directing therapy.Treatment may also include oxygen administration, identification of bleedingsite, control of bleeding by direct measures (such as application of pressureand elevation of a limb) and, possibly, surgery.Special Considerations Management of hypovolemic shock necessitates prompt, aggressivesupportive measures and careful assessment and monitoring of vital signs.Follow these priorities: Check for a patent airway and adequate circulation. If blood pressure andheart rate are absent, start CPR. Record blood pressure, pulse rate, peripheral pulses, respiratory rate, andother vital signs every 15 minutes and the electrocardiographcontinuously. Systolic blood pressure lower than 80 mm Hg usuallyresults in inadequate coronary artery blood flow, cardiac ischemia,arrhythmias, and further complications of low cardiac output. When bloodpressure drops below 80 mm Hg, increase the oxygen flow rate and notifythe practitioner immediately. A progressive drop in blood pressure,accompanied by a thready pulse, generally signals inadequate cardiacoutput from reduced intravascular volume. Notify the practitioner andincrease the infusion rate.",10,103
139,"Start IV. lines with normal saline or lactated Ringer solution, using alarge-bore catheter (14G), which allows easier administration of laterblood transfusions. (Caution: Don t start I.V. lines in the legs of a patientin shock who has suffered abdominal trauma, because infused fluid mayescape through the ruptured vessel into the abdomen.)An indwelling urinary catheter may be inserted to measure hourly urineoutput. If output is less than 30 m L/hour in adults, increase the fluidinfusion rate, but watch for signs of fluid overload such as an increase in PAWP. Notify the practitioner if urine output doesn t improve. An osmoticdiuretic such as mannitol may be ordered to increase renal blood flow andurine output. Determine how much fluid to give by checking bloodpressure, urine output, CVP, or PAWP. (To increase accuracy, CVP shouldbe measured at the level of the right atrium, using the same reference pointon the chest each time.) Draw an arterial blood sample to measure blood gas levels. Administeroxygen by face mask or airway to ensure adequate oxygenation of tissues.Adjust the oxygen flow rate to a higher or lower level, as blood gasmeasurements indicate. Draw venous blood for complete blood count and electrolyte, type andcrossmatch, and coagulation studies. During therapy, assess skin color and temperature, and note changes.Cold, clammy skin may be a sign of continuing peripheral vascularconstriction, indicating progressive shock. Watch for signs of impending coagulopathy (petechiae, bruising, andbleeding or oozing from gums or venipuncture sites). Explain procedures and their purpose. Throughout these emergencymeasures, provide emotional support to the patient and family. HITEM PREVENTION Recognize patients with conditions that reduce blood volume as at-riskpatients. Estimate fluid loss and replace, as necessary, to prevent hypovolemicshock,CARDIOGENIC SHOCK",19,106
140,"Causes and Incidence Sometimes called pump failure, cardiogenic shock is a condition ofdiminished cardiac output that severely impairs tissue perfusion. It reflectssevere left-sided heart failure and occurs as a serious complication in 5 to10 of all patients hospitalized with acute MI. Cardiogenic shock can resultfrom any condition that causes significant left ventricular dysfunction withreduced cardiac output, such as MI (most common), myocardial ischemia,papillary muscle dysfunction, or end-stage cardiomyopathy. The incidence ofcardiogenic shock is higher those with an elevated body mass index, and alsohigher in men than in women because of their higher incidence of CAD.Historically, mortality for cardiogenic shock had been 80 to 90 , butrecent studies indicate that the rate has dropped to 40 to 50 due toimproved interventional procedures and better therapies. Mortality isexpected to decline even further.Pathophysiology Regardless of the underlying cause, left ventricular dysfunction sets intomotion a series of compensatory mechanisms that attempt to increase cardiacoutput and, in tum, maintain vital organ function. (See What happens incardiogenic shock, page 57.) As cardiac output falls in left ventriculardysfunction, aortic and carotid baroreceptors initiate sympathetic nervousresponses, which increase heart rate, left ventricular filling pressure, andperipheral resistance to flow, to enhance venous retum to the heart. Thesecompensatory responses initially stabilize the patient but later causedeterioration with the rising oxygen demands of the already compromisedmyocardium. These events comprise a vicious circle of low cardiac output,sympathetic compensation, myocardial ischemia, and even lower cardiacoutput.PATHOPHYSIOLOGYWHAT HAPPENS IN CARDIOGENIC SHOCKWhen the myocardium can t contract sufficiently to maintain adequatecardiac output, stroke volume decreases, and the heart can t eject anadequate volume of blood with each contraction. The blood backs upbehind the weakened left ventricle, increasing preload and causing",10,96
141,"pulmonary congestion. In addition, to compensate for the drop in strokevolume, the heart rate increases in an attempt to maintain cardiac output.As a result of the diminished stroke volume, coronary artery perfusionand collateral blood flow decrease. All of these mechanisms increase theheart s workload and enhance left-sided heart failure. The result ismyocardial hypoxia, further decreased cardiac output, and a triggering ofcompensatory mechanisms to prevent decompensation and death.",4,26
142,"Initial insult Decreased myocardialcontractility Decreased strokevolume Increased heart rate Decreased coronary Left ventricular dilation artery perfusion andand backup of blood collateral blood flow Increased preload Myocardial hypoxia Pulmonary congestion Decreased cardiacoutput Decompensation anddeath Decreased leftventricular emptying Signs and Symptoms Cardiogenic shock produces signs of poor tissue perfusion: cold, pale,clammy skin; a decrease in systolic blood pressure to 30 mm Hg belowbaseline, or a sustained reading below 80 mm Hg not attributable to",1,28
143,"medication; tachycardia; rapid, shallow respirations; oliguria ( 20 m L/hour);restlessness; mental confusion and obtundation; narrowing pulse pressure;and cyanosis. Although many of these clinical features also occur in heartfailure and other shock syndromes, they re usually more profound incardiogenic shock.Diagnosis Auscultation may detect gallop rhythm, faint heart sounds, and, possibly, ifthe shock results from rupture of the ventricular septum or papillary muscles,a holosystolic murmur. PAP monitoring may show increased PAP and increased PAWP, reflectinga rise in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload) and increasedresistance to left ventricular emptying (afterload) due to ineffectivepumping and increased PVR. Thermodilution technique measuresdecreased cardiac output. Invasive arterial pressure monitoring may indicate hypotension due toimpaired ventricular ejection. ABG analysis may show metabolic acidosis and hypoxia. ECG may show possible evidence of acute MI, ischemia, or ventricularaneurysm. Echocardiography can determine left ventricular function and revealvalvular abnormalities.Enzyme levels may show elevated CK, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartateaminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase, which point to MI orischemia and suggest heart failure or shock. Troponin I, troponin T, and CK may confirm acute MI.Additional tests determine other conditions that can lead to pumpdysfunction and failure, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade,papillary muscle infarct or rupture, ventricular septal rupture, pulmonaryemboli, venous pooling (associated with vasodilators and continuousintermittent positive-pressure breathing), and hypovolemia.Treatment The aim of treatment is to enhance cardiovascular status by increasingcardiac output, improving myocardial perfusion, and decreasing cardiacworkload with combinations of various cardiovascular drugs and",9,91
144,"mechanical-assist techniques. Myocardial reperfusion can be accomplishedby PTCA, stents, thrombolytic therapy, or bypass grafting. Drug therapy mayinclude dopamine I.V., a vasopressor that increases cardiac output, bloodpressure, and renal blood flow; milrinone or dobutamine IV, inotropicagents that increase myocardial contractility; norepinephrine, when a morepotent vasoconstrictor is necessary; and nitroprusside I.V., a vasodilator thatmay be used with a vasopressor to further improve cardiac output bydecreasing PVR (afterload) and reducing left ventricular end-diastolicpressure (preload). However, the patient s blood pressure must be adequateto support nitroprusside therapy and must be monitored closely.The IABP is a mechanical-assist device that attempts to improve coronaryartery perfusion and decrease cardiac workload. (See Understanding the IABP, page 58.) The inflatable balloon pump is percutaneously or surgicallyinserted through the femoral artery into the descending thoracic aorta. Theballoon inflates during diastole to increase coronary artery perfusionpressure and deflates before systole (before the aortic valve opens) to reduceresistance to ejection (afterload) and reduce cardiac workload. Improvedventricular ejection, which significantly improves cardiac output, and asubsequent vasodilation in the peripheral vasculature lead to lower preloadvolume.Understanding The IABPAn intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) consists of a polyurethane balloonattached to an extemal pump console by means of a large-lumen catheter.It is inserted percutaneously through the femoral artery and positioned inthe descending aorta, just distal to the left subclavian artery and abovethe renal arteries.Push...This extemal pump works in precise counterpoint to the left ventricle,inflating the balloon with helium early in diastole and deflating it justbefore systole. As the balloon inflates, it forces blood toward the aorticvalve, thereby raising pressure in the aortic root and augmenting diastolicpressure to improve coronary perfusion. It also improves peripheral",10,103
145,"circulation by forcing blood through the brachiocephalic, commoncarotid, and subclavian arteries arising from the aortic trunk. ..and Pull The balloon deflates rapidly at the end of diastole, creating a vacuum inthe aorta. This reduces aortic volume and pressure, thereby decreasingthe resistance to left ventricular ejection (afterload). This decreasedworkload, in tum, reduces the heart s oxygen requirements and, combinedwith the improved myocardial perfusion, helps prevent or diminishmyocardial ischemia.",4,25
146,"When drug therapy and IABP insertion fail, treatment may require the useof a ventricular assist device. This device (which may be either temporary orpermanent) diverts systemic blood flow from a diseased ventricle into acentrifugal pump. It assists the heart s pumping action rather than replacing it.Special Considerations At the first sign of cardiogenic shock, check the patient s blood pressureand heart rate. If the patient is hypotensive or is having difficultybreathing, ensure a patent I.V. line and a patent airway, and provideoxygen to promote tissue oxygenation. Notify the practitioner immediately. Monitor ABG values to measure oxygenation and detect acidosis frompoor tissue perfusion. Increase oxygen delivery as indicated. Checkcomplete blood count and electrolyte levels. After diagnosis, monitor cardiac rhythm continuously and assess skincolor, temperature, and other vital signs often. Watch for a drop in systolicblood pressure to less than 80 mm Hg (usually compromising cardiacoutput further). Report hypotension immediately.",12,53
147,"An indwelling urinary catheter may be inserted to measure urine output.Notify the practitioner if output drops below 30 m L/hour. Using a pulmonary artery catheter, closely monitor PAP, PAWP, and, ifequipment is available, cardiac output. A high PAWP indicates heartfailure and should be reported. When a patient is on the IABP, reposition the patient often and performpassive range-of-motion exercises to prevent skin breakdown. However,don t flex the patient s ballooned leg at the hip because this maydisplace or fracture the catheter. Assess pedal pulses and skin temperatureand color to make sure circulation to the leg is adequate. Check thedressing on the insertion site frequently for bleeding, and change itaccording to facility protocol. Also, check the site for hematoma or signsof infection, and culture any drainage. After the patient becomes hemodynamically stable, the frequency ofballoon inflation is gradually reduced to wean from the IABP. Duringweaning, carefully watch for monitor changes, chest pain, and other signsof recurring cardiac ischemia and shock. Provide psychological support and reassurance because the patient andfamily may be anxious about the ICU, IABP, and other tubes and devices.To ease emotional stress, plan your care to allow frequent rest periods,and provide as much privacy as possible.BESEEa S0 PREVENTION Emphasize the fact that prevention requires timely,thorough, and aggressive identification and treatment of causativedisorders.VENTRICULAR ANEURYSMCauses and Incidence A ventricular aneurysm is an outpouching, almost always of the left ventricle,that produces ventricular wall dysfunction in about 25 of patients after MI.Ventricular aneurysm may develop within weeks after MI. Untreatedventricular aneurysm can lead to arrhythmias, systemic embolization, or heartfailure and may cause sudden death. Resection improves the prognosis inpatients with heart failure or refractory patients who have developedventricular arrhythmias.",13,104
148,"Pathophysiology When MI destroys a large muscular section of the left ventricle, necrosisreduces the ventricular wall to a thin sheath of fibrous tissue. Underintracardiac pressure, this thin layer stretches and forms a separatenoncontractile sac (aneurysm). Abnormal muscular wall movementaccompanies ventricular aneurysm and includes akinesia (lack of movement),dyskinesia (paradoxical movement), asynergia (decreased and inadequatemovement), and asynchrony (uncoordinated movement). During systolicejection, the abnormal muscular wall movements associated with theaneurysm cause the remaining normally functioning myocardial fibers toincrease the force of contraction to maintain stroke volume and cardiacoutput. At the same time, a portion of the stroke volume is lost to passivedistention of the noncontractile sac.Complications Ventricular arrhythmias Cerebral embolism Heart failure Death Signs and Symptoms Ventricular aneurysm may cause arrhythmias such as premature ventricularcontractions or ventricular tachycardia palpitations, signs of cardiacdysfunction (weakness on exertion, fatigue, and angina) and, occasionally, avisible or palpable systolic precordial bulge. This condition may also leadto left ventricular dysfunction, with chronic heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue,edema, crackles, gallop rhythm, and JVD); pulmonary edema; systemicembolization; and, with left-sided heart failure, pulsus altemans. Ventricularaneurysms enlarge but seldom rupture.Diagnosis Persistent ventricular arrhythmias, onset of heart failure, or systemicembolization in a patient with left-sided heart failure and a history of MIstrongly suggest ventricular aneurysm. Indicative tests include the following:",8,89
149,"Left ventriculography during catheterization reveals left ventricularenlargement, with an area of akinesia or dyskinesia and diminishedcardiac function. ECG may show persistent ST-T wave elevations after infarction.Chest X-ray may demonstrate an abnormal bulge distorting the heart scontour if the aneurysm is large; the X-ray may be normal if the aneurysmis small.Noninvasive nuclear cardiology scan may indicate the site of infarctionand suggest the area of aneurysm.Echocardiography shows abnormal motion in the left ventricular wall.MRI gives excellent visualization of the heart s apex.Treatment Depending on the aneurysm s size and the complications, treatment maynecessitate only routine medical examination to follow the patient s conditionor aggressive measures for intractable ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure,and emboli.Emergency treatment of ventricular arrhythmia includes antiarrhythmics I.V. or cardioversion. Preventive treatment continues with medications thatdecrease afterload to increase left ventricular function such as ACEinhibitors, anti-ischemic medications for angina, and anticoagulation ifthrombus formation.Emergency treatment for heart failure with pulmonary edema includesoxygen, cardiac glycosides IV. furosemide IV. morphine IV, and, whennecessary, nitroprusside I.V. and intubation. Maintenance therapy may includenitrates, prazosin, and oral hydralazine. Systemic embolization requiresanticoagulation therapy or embolectomy. Refractory ventricular tachycardia,heart failure, recurrent arterial embolization, and persistent angina withcoronary artery occlusion may necessitate surgery, of which the mosteffective procedure is aneurysmectomy with myocardial revascularization.Special Considerations If ventricular tachycardia occurs, administer a prescribed antiarrhythmicsuch as lidocaine. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate. If cardiac arrestdevelops, initiate CPR and call for assistance, resuscitative equipment,and medication.",12,91
150,"Ina patient with heart failure, closely monitor vital signs, heart sounds,intake and output, fluid and electrolyte balances, and BUN and creatininelevels. Because of the threat of systemic embolization, frequently checkperipheral pulses and the color and temperature of extremities. Be alertfor sudden changes in sensorium that indicate cerebral embolization andfor any signs that suggest renal failure or progressive MI.If the patient is scheduled to undergo resection: Before surgery, explain expected postoperative care in the ICU (includinguse of such things as endotracheal ET tube, ventilator, hemodynamicmonitoring, chest tubes, and drainage bottle). After surgery, monitor vital signs, intake and output, heart sounds, andpulmonary artery catheter. Watch for signs of infection, such as fever anddrainage.To prepare the patient for discharge: Teach how to check for pulse irregularity and rate changes. Encourage thepatient to follow the prescribed medication regimen even during thenight and to watch for adverse effects.Because arrhythmias can cause sudden death, refer the family to acommunity-based CPR training program. Provide psychological support for the patient and family.CARDIAC TAMPONADECauses and Incidence In cardiac tamponade, a rapid, unchecked rise in intrapericardial pressureimpairs diastolic filling of the heart. The rise in pressure usually results fromblood or fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac. If fluid accumulatesrapidly, this condition requires emergency lifesaving measures to preventdeath. A slow accumulation and rise in pressure, as in pericardial effusionassociated with malignant tumors, may not produce immediate symptoms,because the fibrous wall of the pericardial sac can gradually stretch toaccommodate as muchas to 2 L of fluid.Increased intrapericardial pressure and cardiac tamponade may beidiopathic (Dressler syndrome) or may result from:",10,99
151,"effusion (in cancer, bacterial infections, tuberculosis, and, rarely, acuterheumatic fever) hemorrhage from trauma (such as gunshot or stab wounds of the chest andperforation by catheter during cardiac or central venous catheterization orpostcardiac surgery) hemorrhage from nontraumatic causes (such as rupture of the heart or greatvessels or anticoagulant therapy in a patient with pericarditis) acute MI end-stage lung cancer heart tumors radiation therapy hypothyroidism systemic lupus erythematosus uremia.Cardiac tamponade occurs in 2 of every 10,000 people.Pathophysiology Increased fluid in the pericardial space leads to increased pressure. The rightventricle is unable to expand adequately, and so pressure shifts theinterventricular septum to the left. This decreases the left ventricle end-diastolic volume, resulting in decreased cardiac output and hypotension.Complications Cardiogenic shock Death Signs and Symptoms Cardiac tamponade classically produces increased venous pressure with JVD, reduced arterial blood pressure, muffled heart sounds on auscultation,and pulsus paradoxus (an abnormal inspiratory drop in systemic bloodpressure 15 mm Hg). The absence of a preexisting pericardial friction rubmay suggest an increase in fluid in the pericardial space. These classicsymptoms represent failure of physiologic compensatory mechanisms tooverride the effects of rapidly rising pericardial pressure, which limitsdiastolic filling of the ventricles and reduces stroke volume to a criticallylow level. Generally, ventricular end-systolic volume may drop because of",6,79
152,"inadequate preload. The increasing pericardial pressure is transmittedequally across the heart cavities, producing a matching rise in intracardiacpressure, especially atrial and end-diastolic ventricular pressures. Cardiactamponade may also cause dyspnea, diaphoresis, pallor or cyanosis, anxiety,tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, restlessness, and hepatomegaly, but thelung fields will be clear. The patient typically sits upright and leans forward.Diagnosis Chest X-ray shows slightly widened mediastinum and cardiomegaly.ECG is rarely diagnostic of tamponade but is useful in ruling out othercardiac disorders. It may reveal changes produced by acute pericarditis. Pulmonary artery catheterization detects increased right atrial pressure,right ventricular diastolic pressure, and CVP. Echocardiography, computed tomography scan, or MRI shows pericardialeffusion with signs of right ventricular and atrial compression.Treatment The goal of treatment is to relieve intrapericardial pressure and cardiaccompression by removing accumulated blood or fluid. Pericardiocentesis(needle aspiration of the pericardial cavity) or surgical creation of anopening (pericardiectomy or pericardial window) dramatically improvessystemic arterial pressure and cardiac output with aspiration of as little as25 m L of fluid. Such treatment necessitates continuous hemodynamic and ECG monitoring in the ICU. Trial volume loading with temporary IV. normalsaline solution and perhaps an inotropic drug, such as isoproterenol ordopamine, may be necessary in the hypotensive patient to maintain cardiacoutput. Although these drugs normally improve myocardial function, they mayfurther compromise an ischemic myocardium after MI.Depending on the cause of tamponade, additional treatment may include: in traumatic injury blood transfusion or a thoracotomy to drainreaccumulating fluid or to repair bleeding sites in heparin-induced tamponade (not often used) the heparin antagonistprotamine sulfate in warfarin-induced tamponade vitamin K.Resection of a portion or all of the pericardium to allow fullcommunication with the pleura may be needed if repeated pericardiocentesis",12,100
153,"fails to prevent recurrence.Special Considerations If the patient needs pericardiocentesis: Explain the procedure to him. Keep a pericardial aspiration needleattached to a 50-m L syringe by a three-way stopcock, an ECG machine,and an emergency cart with a defibrillator at the bedside. Make sure theequipment is tumed on and ready for immediate use. Position the patient ata 45- to 60-degree angle. Connect the precordial ECG lead to the hub ofthe aspiration needle with an alligator clamp and connecting wire, andassist with fluid aspiration. When the needle touches the myocardium,you ll see an ST-segment elevation or premature ventricular contractions. Monitor blood pressure and CVP during and after pericardiocentesis.Infuse I.V. solutions, as prescribed, to maintain blood pressure. Watch fora decrease in CVP and a concomitant rise in blood pressure, whichindicate relief of cardiac compression. Watch for complications of pericardiocentesis, such as ventricularfibrillation, vasovagal response, or coronary artery or cardiac chamberpuncture. Closely monitor ECG changes, blood pressure, pulse rate, LOC,and urine output.If the patient needs thoracotomy: Explain the procedure to him. Tell the patient what to expectpostoperatively (chest tubes, drainage bottles, and oxygen administration).Teach the patient how to tum, deep breathe, and cough. Give antibiotics, protamine sulfate, or vitamin K, as ordered. Postoperatively, monitor critical parameters, such as vital signs and ABGvalues, and assess heart and breath sounds. Give pain medication asordered. Maintain the chest drainage system and be alert forcomplications, such as hemorrhage and arrhythmias.HEE PREVENTION Instruct patient to practice heart-healthy living, with aheart-healthy diet, stress reduction, regular exercise and preventive care,maintenance of a healthy weight, smoking cessation, and abstinence fromalcohol.",16,105
154,"CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIASCauses and Incidence Arrhythmias may be congenital or may result from one of several factors,including myocardial ischemia, MI, or organic heart disease. Drug ingestion(cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine, BBs, psychotropics, sympathomimetics),drug toxicity, or degeneration of the conductive tissue necessary to maintainnormal heart rhythm (sick sinus syndrome) can sometimes precipitatearrhythmias. People with imbalances of blood chemistries or those with ahistory of cardiac conditions (CAD or heart valve disorders) are at higherrisk for developing arrhythmias.Pathophysiology In cardiac arrhythmias (sometimes called cardiac dysrhythmias), abnormalelectrical conduction or automaticity changes heart rate and rhythm. (See Normal cardiac conduction, page 61.) Arrhythmias vary in severity, fromthose that are mild, asymptomatic, and require no treatment (such as sinusarrhythmia, in which heart rate increases and decreases with respiration) tocatastrophic ventricular fibrillation, which necessitates immediateresuscitation. Arrhythmias are generally classified according to their origin(ventricular or supraventricular). Their effect on cardiac output and bloodpressure, partially influenced by the site of origin, determines their clinicalsignificance. (See Types of cardiac arrhythmias, pages 65 to 71.)Normal Cardiac Conduction The conduction system of the heart begins with the heart s pacemaker: thesinoatrial (sinoatrial) node. When an impulse leaves the sinoatrial node, it travelsthrough the atria along the Bachmann bundle and the intemodal tracts onits way to the atrioventricular (atrioventricular) node. After the impulse passesthrough the atrioventricular node, it travels to the ventricles, first down the bundle of His, then along the bundle branches and, finally, down the Purkinjefibers.",11,79

Aneurysm of the ascending aortais the most common type and has the highest mortality. Aneurysms may bedissecting, a hemorrhagic separation in the aortic wall, usually within themedial layer; saccular, an outpouching of the arterial wall, with a narrowneck; or fusiform, a spindle-shaped enlargement encompassing the entireaortic circumference. (See Types of aortic aneurysms, page 64.) Some",18,95
171,"aneurysms progress to serious and, eventually, lethal complications, such asrupture of an untreated thoracic dissecting aneurysm into the pericardium,with resulting tamponade.Thoracic aortic aneurysms commonly result from atherosclerosis, whichweakens the aortic wall and gradually distends the lumen. An intimal tear inthe ascending aorta initiates dissecting aneurysm in about 65 of patients.Regardless of causation, these aneurysms affect 6 out of every 100,000people.a ELDER TIP Ascending aortic aneurysms, the most common type, areusually seen in hypertensive men younger than 60 years old.Descending aortic aneurysms, usually found just below the origin of thesubclavian artery, are most common in elderly men who are hypertensive.Descending aortic aneurysms are also seen in younger patients with ahistory of traumatic chest injury less often in those with infection. Transverseaortic aneurysms are the least common type.Other causes include: fungal infection (mycotic aneurysms) of the aortic arch and descendingsegments congenital disorders, such as coarctation of the aorta and Marfansyndrome trauma, usually of the descending thoracic aorta, from an accident thatshears the aorta transversely (acceleration deceleration injuries)Pathophysiology Most aneurysms result from changes to the vascular wall of arteries causedby failure of important proteins, elastin and collagen, leading to dilation.This eventually affects the structural stability and strength of the vessel. Thelocation of the aneurysm, its diameter, the cause, and its morphologyall assistin determining rate of expansion per year. Saccular aneurysms are thought torupture more readily than other types, such as fusiform.Complications Rupture into pericardium Cardiac tamponade",5,82
172,"Signs and Symptoms The most common symptom of thoracic aortic aneurysm is pain. Withascending aneurysm, the pain is described as severe, boring, and ripping andextends to the neck, shoulders, lower back, or abdomen but seldom radiatesto the jaw and arms. Pain is more severe on the right side.Other signs of ascending aneurysm may include bradycardia, aorticinsufficiency, pericardial friction rub caused by a hemopericardium, unequalintensities of the right carotid and left radial pulses, and a difference in bloodpressure between the right and the left arms. These signs are absent indescending aneurysm. If dissection involves the carotids, an abrupt onset ofneurologic deficits may occur.With descending aneurysm, pain usually starts suddenly between theshoulder blades and may radiate to the chest; it s described as sharp andtearing. Transverse aneurysm causes a sudden, sharp, tearing pain radiatingto the shoulders. It may also cause hoarseness, dyspnea, dysphagia, and a drycough because of compression of surrounding structures in this area.

Surgical repair is alsorequired Diagnosis Diagnosis relies on patient history, clinical features, and appropriate tests. Inan asymptomatic patient, diagnosis often occurs accidentally when chest X-rays show widening of the aorta. Other tests help confirm aneurysm: Aortography can show the lumen of the aneurysm, its size and location,and the false lumen in dissecting aneurysm.ECG helps distinguish thoracic aneurysm from MI. Echocardiography may help identify dissecting aneurysm of the aorticroot. Hemoglobin levels may be normal or low, due to blood loss fromaleaking aneurysm. Computed tomography scan is considered the gold standard and canconfirm and locate the aneurysm and may be used to monitor itsprogression.",11,100
174,"MRI may aid diagnosis. Transesophageal echocardiography is used to diagnose and size ananeurysm in either the ascending or the descending aorta. Ultrasound is frequently used for screening purposes in high-risk patients.Treatment Dissecting aortic aneurysm is an emergency that requires prompt surgery andstabilizing measures: antihypertensives such as nitroprusside; negativeinotropic agents that decrease contractility force such as propranolol; oxygenfor respiratory distress; opioids for pain; IV. fluids and, possibly, wholeblood transfusions.Surgery consists of resecting the aneurysm, restoring normal blood flowthrough a graft replacement, and, with aortic valve insufficiency, replacingthe aortic valve. Groin catheter placement may be used for aortic stenting.This procedure, which may be used for aneurysms of the descending aorta,eliminates the need for a chest incision.Postoperative measures include careful monitoring and continuousassessment in the ICU, antibiotics, placement of ET and chest tubes, ECGmonitoring, and pulmonary artery catheterization.Long-term management includes treatment of underlying conditions, suchas heart disease and diabetes.Special Considerations Monitor blood pressure, PAWP, and CVP. Assess pain; breathing; andcarotid, radial, and femoral pulses.Make sure laboratory tests include complete blood count, differential,electrolyte levels, type and crossmatching for whole blood, ABG studies,and urinalysis. Insert an indwelling urinary catheter. Administer dextrose 5 in water orlactated Ringer solution, and antibiotics, as ordered. Carefully monitomitroprusside I.V., if ordered; use a separate IV. line for infusion. Adjustthe dose by slowly increasing the infusion rate. Meanwhile, check bloodpressure every 5 minutes until it stabilizes. With suspected bleeding fromaneurysm, give whole blood transfusion. Explain diagnostic tests. If surgery is scheduled, explain the procedureand expected postoperative care (1.V. lines, ET and drainage tubes,",16,107
175,"cardiac monitoring, and ventilation).After repair of thoracic aneurysm: Assess LOC. Monitor vital signs; PAP, PAWP, and CVP; pulse rate; urineoutput; and pain.Check respiratory function. Carefully observe and record type and amountof chest tube drainage, and frequently assess heart and breath sounds. Monitor IV. therapy.Give medications as appropriate. Watch for signs of infection, especially fever, and excessive wounddrainage. Assist with range-of-motion exercises of legs to prevent thromboembolicphenomenon due to venostasis during prolonged bed rest. After stabilization of vital signs and respiration, encourage and assist thepatient in tuming, coughing, and deep breathing. If necessary, provideintermittent positive-pressure breathing to promote lung expansion. Helpthe patient walk as soon as he or she is able.Before discharge, ensure compliance with antihypertensive therapy byexplaining the need for such drugs and the expected adverse effects. Teachthe patient how to monitor blood pressure. Refer to community agenciesfor continued support and assistance, as needed. Throughout hospitalization, offer the patient and family psychologicalsupport. Answer all of their questions honestly and provide reassurance.ABDOMINAL ANEURYSMCauses and Incidence Abdominal aneurysm, an abnormal dilation in the arterial wall, generallyoccurs in the aorta between the renal arteries and the iliac branches. Rupture in which the aneurysm breaks open, resulting in profuse bleeding is acommon complication that occurs in larger aneurysms. Dissection occurswhen the artery s lining tears, and blood leaks into the walls.Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) result from arteriosclerosis,hypertension, congenital weakening, cystic medial necrosis, trauma, syphilis,and other infections. In children, this disorder can result from bluntabdominal injury or Marfan syndrome.",17,99
176,"This disorder is four times more common in men than in women and ismost prevalent in whites 40 to 70 years old. It is especially prevalent in malesmokers who are 65 and older. Less than 50 of people with a ruptured AAA survive.Pathophysiology These aneurysms develop slowly. First, a focal weakness in the muscularlayer of the aorta (tunica media), due to degenerative changes, allows theinner layer (tunica intima) and outer layer (tunica adventitia) to stretchoutward. Blood pressure within the aorta progressively weakens the vesselwalls and enlarges the aneurysm.Complications Rupture Hemorrhage Shock Signs and Symptoms Although abdominal aneurysms usually don t produce symptoms, most areevident (unless the patient is obese) as a pulsating mass in the periumbilicalarea, accompanied by a systolic bruit over the aorta. Some tendemess maybe present on deep palpation. A large aneurysm may produce symptoms thatmimic renal calculi, lumbar disk disease, and duodenal compression.Abdominal aneurysms rarely cause diminished peripheral pulses orclaudication, unless embolization occurs.Lumbar pain that radiates to the flank and groin from pressure on lumbamerves may signify enlargement and imminent rupture. A rare but recognizedsymptom is unrelenting testicular pain with no other cause. If the aneurysmruptures into the peritoneal cavity, it causes severe, persistent abdominal andback pain, mimicking renal or ureteral colic. Signs of hemorrhage such asweakness, sweating, tachycardia, and hypotension may be subtle becauserupture into the retroperitoneal space produces a tamponade effect thatprevents continued hemorrhage. Patients with such rupture may remain stablefor hours before shock and death occur, although 20 die immediately.Diagnosis",11,97
177,"Because abdominal aneurysms seldom produce symptoms, they re commonlydetected accidentally as the result of an X-ray or a routine physicalexamination.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Several tests can confirm a suspectedabdominal aneurysm. Serial ultrasound (sonography) can accuratelydetermine the aneurysm size, shape, and location. Anteroposterior andlateral X-rays of the abdomen can detect aortic calcification, whichoutlines the mass, at least 75 of the time. Aortography shows thecondition of vessels proximal and distal to the aneurysm and theaneurysms extent but may underestimate aneurysm diameter because itvisualizes only the flow channel and not the surrounding clot. Computedtomography scan is used to diagnose and size the aneurysm. MRI can beused as an altemative to aortography.Treatment Usually, abdominal aneurysm requires resection of the aneurysm andreplacement of the damaged aortic section with a Dacron graft. (See Abdominal aneurysms: Before and after surgery, page 75. Also see Endovascular grafting for repair of an AAA, page 76.) If the aneurysm issmall and asymptomatic, surgery may be delayed, and the aneurysm may befollowed and allowed to expand to a certain size because of possiblesurgical complications; however, small aneurysms may also rupture. Becauseof this risk, surgical repair or replacement is recommended for symptomaticpatients or for patients with aneurysms greater than 5 cm in diameter.Abdominal Aneurysms: Before and After Surgery During surgery, a prosthetic graft replaces or encloses the weakenedarea.Before Surgery Aneurysm below renal arteries and above bifurcation",10,84
178,Before Surgery Aneurysm below renal arteries involving the iliac branches Before Surgery Small aneurysm in a patient with poor distal runoff (poor risk),1,9
179,After Surgery The prosthesis extends distal to the renal arteries to above the aorticbifurcation.After Surgery The prosthesis extends to the common femoral arteries.,1,8
180,"After Surgery The extemal prosthesis encircles the aneurysm and is held in place withsutures. Endovascular Grafting For Repair of An AAAEndovascular grafting is a minimally invasive procedure for the repair ofan abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This procedure reinforces thewalls of the aorta to prevent rupture and prevent expansion of theaneurysm.Endovascular grafting is performed with fluoroscopic guidance: Usinga guide wire, a delivery catheter with an attached compressed graft is",3,26
181,"inserted through a small incision into the femoral or iliac artery. Thedelivery catheter is advanced into the aorta, where it s positioned acrossthe aneurysm. A balloon on the catheter expands the graft and affixes it tothe vessel wall.The procedure generally takes 2 to 3 hours to perform. Patients areinstructed to walk the first day after surgery and are generally dischargedfrom the facility in 1 to 3 days. Stenting is also a treatment option. It can be performed without anabdominal incision by introducing the catheters through arteries in the groin.However, not all patients with AAAs are candidates for this treatment.Regular physical examination and ultrasound checks are necessary todetect enlargement, which may forewam rupture. Large aneurysms or thosethat produce symptoms pose a significant risk of rupture and necessitate",7,39
182,"immediate repair. In patients with poor distal runoff, extemal grafting may bedone.Risk factor modification is fundamental in the medical management ofabdominal aneurysm, including control of hypocholesterolemia andhypertension. BBs are commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of aneurysmexpansion and rupture.Special Considerations Abdominal aneurysm requires meticulous preoperative and postoperativecare, psychological support, and comprehensive patient teaching. Followingdiagnosis, if rupture isn t imminent, elective surgery allows time foradditional preoperative tests to evaluate the patient s clinical status. Monitor vital signs, and type and crossmatch blood. Use only gentle abdominal palpation. As ordered, obtain renal function tests (BUN, creatinine, and electrolytelevels), blood samples (complete blood count with differential),electrocardiogram and cardiac evaluation, baseline pulmonary functiontests, and ABG analysis.Be alert for signs of rupture, which may be immediately fatal. Watchclosely for signs of acute blood loss (decreasing blood pressure;increasing pulse and respiratory rate; cool, clammy skin; restlessness; anddecreased sensorium).If rupture does occur, the first priority is to get the patient to surgeryimmediately. Surgery allows direct compression of the aorta to controlhemorrhage. Large amounts of blood may be needed during theresuscitative period to replace blood loss. In such a patient, renal failurecaused by ischemia is a major postoperative complication, possiblyrequiring hemodialysis.Before elective surgery, weigh the patient, insert an indwelling urinarycatheter and an I.V. line, and assist with insertion of an arterial line andpulmonary artery catheter to monitor fluid and hemodynamic balance.Give prophylactic antibiotics as ordered.Explain the surgical procedure and the expected postoperative care in the ICU for patients undergoing complex abdominal surgery (1.V. lines, ETand NG intubation, and mechanical ventilation).",13,102
183,"After surgery, in the ICU, closely monitor vital signs, intake and hourlyoutput, neurologic status (LOC, pupil size, and sensation in arms andlegs), and ABG values. Assess the depth, rate, and character ofrespirations and breath sounds at least every hour. Watch for signs of bleeding (increased pulse and respiratory rates andhypotension) and back pain, which may indicate that the graft is tearing.Check abdominal dressings for excessive bleeding or drainage. Be alertfor temperature elevations and other signs of infection. After NGintubation for intestinal decompression, irrigate the tube frequently toensure patency. Record the amount and type of drainage. Suction the ET tube often. If the patient can breathe unassisted and hasgood breath sounds and adequate ABG values, tidal volume, and vitalcapacity 24 hours after surgery, it is likely he or she will be extubated andwill require oxygen by mask.Weigh the patient daily to evaluate fluid balance. Help the patient walk as soon as able (generally the second day aftersurgery). Provide psychological support for the patient and family. Help ease theirfears about the ICU, the threat of impending rupture, and surgery byproviding appropriate explanations and answering all questions.FEMORAL AND POPLITEAL ANEURYSMSCauses and Incidence Femoral and popliteal aneurysms (sometimes called peripheral arterialaneurysms) are the end result of progressive atherosclerotic changesoccurring in the walls (medial layer) of these major peripheral arteries.These aneurysmal formations may be fusiform (spindle-shaped) or saccular(pouchlike); the fusiform type is three times more common. They may besingular or multiple segmental lesions, often affecting both legs, and mayaccompany other arterial aneurysms located in the abdominal aorta or iliacarteries.Femoral and popliteal aneurysms are usually secondary to atherosclerosis.Rarely, they result from congenital weakness in the arterial wall. They mayalso result from trauma (blunt or penetrating), bacterial infection, or",13,111
184,"peripheral vascular reconstructive surgery (which causes suture line aneurysms, or false aneurysms, in which a blood clot forms a second lumen).This condition occurs most frequently in men older than 50. The clinicalcourse is usually progressive, eventually ending in thrombosis, embolization,and gangrene. Elective surgery before complications arise greatly improvesthe prognosis.Pathophysiology As with other aneurysms, a weakening of the vessel wall caused byinflammation, proteolysis, and changes in the matrix result in the outpouchingseen in this condition.Complications Amputation of thrombosis Emboli Gangrene Signs and Symptoms Popliteal aneurysms may cause pain in the popliteal space when they re largeenough to compress the medial popliteal nerve and edema and venousdistention if the vein is compressed. Femoral and popliteal aneurysms canproduce symptoms of severe ischemia in the leg or foot due to acutethrombosis within the aneurysmal sac, embolization of mural thrombusfragments and, rarely, rupture. Symptoms of acute aneurysmal thrombosisinclude severe pain, loss of pulse and color, coldness in the affected leg orfoot, and gangrene. Distal petechial hemorrhages may develop fromaneurysmal emboli.Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually confirmed by bilateral palpation that reveals a pulsatingmass above or below the inguinal ligament in femoral aneurysm. Whenthrombosis has occurred, palpation detects a firm, nonpulsating mass.Arteriography or ultrasound may be indicated in doubtful situations.Arteriography may also detect associated aneurysms, especially those in theabdominal aorta and the iliac arteries. Ultrasound may be helpful indetermining the size of the popliteal or femoral artery.",8,93
185,"Treatment Femoral and popliteal aneurysms require surgical bypass and reconstructionof the artery, usually with an autogenous saphenous vein graft replacement.Arterial occlusion that causes severe ischemia and gangrene may require legamputation.Special Considerations Before corrective surgery: Assess and record circulatory status, noting the location and quality ofperipheral pulses in the affected arm or leg. Administer prophylactic antibiotics or anticoagulants, as ordered. Discuss postoperative procedures and review the explanation of thesurgery.After arterial surgery: Monitor carefully for early signs of thrombosis or graft occlusion (loss ofpulse, decreased skin temperature and sensation, and severe pain) andinfection (fever). Palpate distal pulses at least every hour for the first 24 hours and then asfrequently as ordered. Correlate these findings with preoperativecirculatory assessment. Mark the sites on the patient s skin where pulsesare palpable to facilitate repeated checks. Help the patient walk soon after surgery to prevent venostasis andpossible thrombus formation.To prepare the patient for discharge: Tell the patient to immediately report any recurrence of symptoms becausethe saphenous vein graft replacement can fail or another aneurysm maydevelop. Explain to the patient with popliteal artery resection that swelling maypersist for some time. If antiembolism stockings are ordered, make surethey fit properly and teach the patient how to apply them.

Wam the patient to avoid trauma, tobacco,and aspirin.THROMBOPHLEBITISCauses and Incidence An acute condition characterized by inflammation and thrombus formation,thrombophlebitis may occur in deep (intermuscular or intramuscular) orsuperficial (subcutaneous) veins. DVT or thrombophlebitis affects smallveins, such as the soleal venous sinuses, or large veins, such as the vena cavaand the femoral, iliac, and subclavian veins, causing venous insufficiency.(See Chronic venous insufficiency, page 78.) This disorder is typicallyprogressive, leading to pulmonary embolism, a potentially lethalcomplication. Superficial thrombophlebitis is usually self-limiting andseldom leads to pulmonary embolism. Thrombophlebitis often begins withlocalized inflammation alone (phlebitis), but such inflammation rapidlyprovokes thrombus formation. Rarely, venous thrombosis develops withoutassociated inflammation of the vein (phlebothrombosis).Chronic Venous Insufficiency Chronic venous insufficiency results from the valvular destruction ofdeep vein thrombophlebitis, usually in the iliac and femoral veins, andoccasionally the saphenous veins. It s often accompanied byincompetence of the communicating veins at the ankle, causing increasedvenous pressure and fluid migration into the interstitial tissue. Clinicaleffects include chronic swelling of the affected leg from edema, leadingto tissue fibrosis, and induration; skin discoloration from extravasation ofblood in subcutaneous tissue; and stasis ulcers around the ankle.Treatment of small ulcers includes bed rest, elevation of the legs,warm soaks, and antimicrobial therapy for infection. Treatment tocounteract increased venous pressure, the result of reflux from the deepvenous system to surface veins, may include compression dressings, suchas a sponge rubber pressure dressing or a zinc gelatin boot (Unna boot).",12,96
187,"This therapy begins after massive swelling subsides with leg elevationand bed rest.Large stasis ulcers unresponsive to conservative treatment may requireexcision and skin grafting. Patient care includes daily inspection toassess healing. Other care measures are the same as for varicose veins.DVT may be idiopathic, but it usually results from endothelial damage,accelerated blood clotting, and reduced blood flow, known as the Virchowtriad. Predisposing factors are prolonged bed rest, trauma, surgery,childbirth, and use of hormonal contraceptives such as estrogens. It occurs inabout 80 of every 100,000 people; 1 of every 20 persons is affected at somepoint during their lifetime. Males are at slightly greater risk than females.People older than 40 are also at increased risk.Causes of superficial thrombophlebitis include trauma, infection, IV. drugabuse, and chemical irritation due to extensive use of the I.V. route formedications and diagnostic tests.Pathophysiology A thrombus occurs when an alteration in the epithelial lining causes plateletaggregation and consequent fibrin entrapment of red and white blood cellsand additional platelets. Thrombus formation is more rapid in areas whereblood flow is slower, due to greater contact between platelet and thrombinaccumulation. The rapidly expanding thrombus initiates a chemicalinflammatory process in the vessel epithelium, which leads to fibrosis. Theenlarging clot may occlude the vessel lumen partially or totally, or it maydetach and embolize to lodge elsewhere in the systemic circulation.Complications Pulmonary embolism Chronic venous insufficiency Signs and Symptoms In both types of thrombophlebitis, clinical features vary with the site andlength of the affected vein. Although DVT may occur asymptomatically, itmay also produce severe pain, fever, chills, malaise and, possibly, swellingand cyanosis of the affected arm or leg. Superficial thrombophlebitis",13,107
188,"produces visible and palpable signs, such as heat, pain, swelling, rubor,tendemess, and induration along the length of the affected vein. Varicoseveins may also be present. (See Varicose veins, page 79.) Extensive veininvolvement may cause lymphadenitis.Varicose Veins Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous veins, usually affecting thesubcutaneous leg veins the saphenous veins and their branches. Theycan result from congenital weakness of the valves or venous wall,diseases of the venous system such as deep vein thrombophlebitis,conditions that produce prolonged venostasis such as pregnancy, oroccupations that necessitate standing for an extended period.Varicose veins may be asymptomatic or may produce mild to severeleg symptoms, including a feeling of heaviness; cramps at might; diffuse,dull aching after prolonged standing or walking; aching during menses;fatigability; palpable nodules, and, with deep vein incompetency,orthostatic edema and stasis pigmentation of the calves and ankles.Treatment In mild-to-moderate varicose veins, antiembolism stockings or elasticbandages counteract pedal and ankle swelling by supporting the veinsand improving circulation. An exercise program such as walkingpromotes muscular contraction and forces blood through the veins,thereby minimizing venous pooling. Severe varicose veins maynecessitate stripping and ligation or, as an altemative to surgery, injectionof a sclerosing agent into small affected vein segments.To promote comfort and minimize worsening of varicosities: Discourage the patient from wearing constrictive clothing. Advise the patient to elevate the legs above heart level wheneverpossible and to avoid prolonged standing or sitting.After stripping and ligation or after injection of a sclerosing agent: Torelieve pain, administer analgesics as ordered.Frequently check circulation in toes (color and temperature) andobserve elastic bandages for bleeding. When ordered, rewrap",9,113
189,"bandages at least once a shift, wrapping from toe to thigh, with the legelevated. Watch for signs of complications, such as sensory loss in the leg(which could indicate saphenous nerve damage), calf pain(thrombophlebitis), and fever (infection).Diagnosis Findings are usually nonspecific and are not reliable for making thediagnosis of DVT. Essential laboratory tests include:Duplex Doppler is most commonly performed; this makes it possible tononinvasively examine the major veins (but not calf veins).fey CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Compression ultrasonography with Doppler isthe diagnostic test of choice in the evaluation of DVT.Diagnosis must also rule out PAD, lymphangitis, cellulitis, and myositis.Diagnosis of superficial thrombophlebitis is based on_ physicalexamination (redness and warmth over the affected area, palpable vein, andpain during palpation or compression).Treatment The goals of treatment are to control thrombus development, preventcomplications, relieve pain, and prevent recurrence of the disorder.Symptomatic measures include bed rest, with elevation of the affected arm orleg; warm, moist soaks to the affected area; and analgesics. After the acuteepisode of DVT subsides, the patient may resume activity while wearingantiembolism stockings that were applied before getting out of bed.Treatment also includes anticoagulants to prolong clotting time. Whilewarfarin is still an option for the treatment of DVT, new medications are nowavailable that are safer, as effective, and do not require monitoring of bloodlevels through frequent lab draws. These medications are called direct factor Xa inhibitors and include rivaroxaban and apixaban. If the patient is not acandidate for these novel medications, low-molecular-weight (LMW)heparin has been shown to be effective in treating DVT or can be used asbridge therapy until a therapeutic level of warfarin is achieved. Although LMW heparin is more expensive, it doesn t require monitoring for its",8,97
190,"anticoagulant effect, either. Full anticoagulant doses must be discontinuedduring any operative period because of the risk of hemorrhage. After sometypes of surgery, especially major abdominal or pelvic operations,prophylactic doses of anticoagulants may reduce the risk of DVT andpulmonary embolism. For lysis of acute, extensive DVT, treatment mayinclude thrombolysis with or without thrombectomy. Rarely, DVT may causecomplete venous occlusion, which necessitates venous interruption throughsimple ligation to vein plication, or clipping. Embolectomy and insertion of avena caval umbrella or filter may also be done.Therapy for severe superficial thrombophlebitis may include an anti-inflammatory drug such as indomethacin, antiembolism stockings, warmsoaks, and elevation of the leg.Special Considerations Patient teaching, identification of high-risk patients, and measures to preventvenostasis can prevent DVT; close monitoring of anticoagulant therapy canprevent serious complications such as intemal hemorrhage. Enforce bed rest as ordered, and elevate the patient s affected arm or leg.If you plan to use pillows for elevating the leg, place them so they supportthe entire length of the affected extremity to prevent possible compressionof the popliteal space. Apply warm soaks to increase circulation to the affected area and torelieve pain and inflammation. Give analgesics to relieve pain, asordered.Measure and record the affected arm or leg s circumference daily, andcompare this measurement to the other arm or leg. To ensure accuracy andconsistency of serial measurements, mark the skin over the area andmeasure at the same spot daily. Administer heparin I.V., as ordered, with an infusion monitor or pump tocontrol the flow rate if necessary. Remember that this medication is notbeing used as often with the growing popularity of direct factor Xainhibitors.Measure partial thromboplastin time regularly for the patient on heparintherapy; prothrombin time and intemational normalized ratio (INR) for thepatient on warfarin (therapeutic anticoagulation values are 1 to 2 timescontrol values for prothrombin time and an INR of 2 to 3). Watch for signs",13,117
191,"and symptoms of bleeding, such as dark, tarry stools; coffee-groundvomitus; and ecchymosis. Encourage the patient to use an electric razorand to avoid medications that contain aspirin. Be alert for signs of pulmonary emboli (crackles, dyspnea, hemoptysis,sudden changes in mental status, restlessness, and hypotension).To prepare the patient with thrombophlebitis for discharge: Emphasize the importance of follow-up blood studies to monitoranticoagulant therapy, if necessary.If the patient is being discharged on heparin therapy, teach the patient orfamily how to give subcutaneous injections. If the patient requires furtherassistance, arrange for a home health nurse. Tell the patient to avoid prolonged sitting or standing to help preventrecurrence. Teach the patient how to properly apply and use antiembolism stockings.Tell the patient to report any complications such as cold, blue toes. (See Preventing thrombophlebitis.)PREVENTIONPREVENTING THROMBOPHLEBITISTo prevent thrombophlebitis in a high-risk patient, perform range-of-motion exercise while the patient is on bed rest, use intermittentpneumatic calf massage during lengthy surgical or diagnostic procedures,apply antiembolism stockings postoperatively, and encourage earlyambulation.After some types of surgery, especially major abdominal or pelvicoperations, prophylactic doses of anticoagulants may reduce the risk ofdeep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.RAYNAUD DISEASECauses and Incidence Raynaud disease is one of several primary arteriospastic disorderscharacterized by episodic vasospasm in the small peripheral arteries and",8,71
192,"arterioles, precipitated by exposure to cold or stress. This condition occursbilaterally and usually affects the hands or, less often, the feet. Raynauddisease is most prevalent in females, particularly those between puberty and40 years old. It s a benign condition, requiring no specific treatment andcausing no serious sequelae.Although the cause is unknown, several theories account for the reduceddigital blood flow: intrinsic vascular wall hyperactivity to cold, increasedvasomotor tone due to sympathetic stimulation, and antigen-antibody immuneresponse (the most likely theory because abnormal immunologic test resultsaccompany Raynaud phenomenon). Risk factors include associated diseases(Buerger disease, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and SLE) and smoking.This disorder affects females more often than males.Raynaud phenomenon, however, a condition commonly associated withseveral connective tissue disorders such as scleroderma, SLE, orpolymyositis has a progressive course, leading to ischemia, gangrene, andamputation. Distinguishing between the two disorders is difficult becausesome patients who experience mild symptoms of Raynaud disease for severalyears may later develop overt connective tissue disease especiallyscleroderma.Pathophysiology Complications Ischemia Gangrene Amputation Signs and Symptoms After exposure to cold or stress, the skin on the fingers typically blanchesand then becomes cyanotic before changing to red and before changing fromcold to normal temperature. Numbness and tingling may also occur. Thesesymptoms are relieved by warmth. In long-standing disease, trophic changes,such as sclerodactyly, ulcerations, or chronic paronychia, may result.Although it s extremely uncommon, minimal cutaneous gangrene necessitatesamputation of one or more phalanges.",9,91
193,"Diagnosis Clinical criteria that establish Raynaud disease include skin color changesinduced by cold or stress; bilateral involvement; absence of gangrene or, ifpresent, minimal cutaneous gangrene; normal arterial pulses; and patienthistory of clinical symptoms of longer than 2 years duration. Diagnosis mustalso rule out secondary disease processes, such as chronic arterial occlusiveor connective tissue disease.Treatment Initially, treatment consists of avoidance of cold, mechanical, or chemicalinjury; cessation of smoking; and reassurance that symptoms are benign.Because adverse drug effects, especially from vasodilators, may be morebothersome than the disease itself, drug therapy is reserved for unusuallysevere symptoms. Such therapy may include low doses of nifedipine.Sympathectomy may be helpful when conservative modalities fail to preventischemic ulcers and becomes necessary in less than 25 of patients.Special Considerations Wam the patient against exposure to the cold. Tell the patient to wearmittens or gloves in cold weather or when handling cold items ordefrosting the freezer. Advise the patient to avoid stressful situations and to stop smoking. Instruct the patient to inspect the skin frequently and to seek immediatecare for signs of skin breakdown or infection. Teach the patient about drugs, their use, and their adverse effects. Provide psychological support and reassurance to allay the patient s fearof amputation and disfigurement.BUERGER DISEASECauses and Incidence Buerger disease (sometimes called thromboangiitis obliterans) aninflammatory, nonatheromatous occlusive condition causes segmentallesions and subsequent thrombus formation in the small and medium arteries(and sometimes the veins), resulting in decreased blood flow to the feet andlegs. This disorder may produce ulceration and, eventually, gangrene.",9,94
194,"Buerger disease is caused by vasculitis, an inflammation of blood vessels,primarily of the hands and feet. The vessels become constricted or totallyblocked, reducing blood flow to the tissues and resulting in pain and,eventually, damage.This disorder occurs in 12 to 20 of every 100,000 people. Incidence ishighest among males 20 to 40 years old who have a history of smoking orchewing tobacco. It may be associated with a history of Raynaud disease andmay occur in people with autoimmune disease.Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of Buerger disease is not well understood. In the acutephase, occlusive thrombi develop in arteries and veins of distal extremities.Next, thrombi start to organize into larger vessels. Over time, inflammationresides but fibrosis and organized thrombi remain.There is also evidence that dysfunction of the endothelial layer of thevessels occurs, as well as the possibility of issues with prothrombin.Complications Gangrene Muscle atrophy Ulceration Signs and Symptoms Buerger disease typically produces intermittent claudication of the instep,which is aggravated by exercise and relieved by rest. During exposure tolow temperature, the feet initially become cold, cyanotic, and numb; later,they redden, become hot, and tingle. Occasionally, Buerger disease alsoaffects the hands, possibly resulting in painful fingertip ulcerations.Associated signs and symptoms may include impaired peripheral pulses,migratory superficial thrombophlebitis and, in later stages, ulceration,muscle atrophy, and gangrene.Diagnosis Patient history and physical examination strongly suggest Buerger disease.Supportive diagnostic tests include:",8,89
195,"Doppler ultrasonography to show diminished circulation in the peripheralvessels angiography or arteriography to locate lesions and rule outatherosclerosis.Treatment The primary goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms and preventcomplications. Such therapy may include an exercise program that usesgravity to fill and drain the blood vessels or, in severe disease, a lumbarsympathectomy to increase blood supply to the skin. Aspirin and vasodilatorsmay also be used. Amputation may be necessary for nonhealing ulcers,intractable pain, or gangrene.Special Considerations Strongly urge the patient to stop smoking to enhance the treatment seffectiveness. Symptoms may disappear if the patient stops tobacco use. Ifnecessary, refer the patient to a self-help group to stop smoking.Wam the patient to avoid precipitating factors, such as emotional stress,exposure to extreme temperatures, and trauma.Teach the patient proper foot care, especially the importance of wearingwell-fitting shoes and cotton or wool socks. Show the patient how toinspect feet daily for cuts, abrasions, and signs of skin breakdown, such asredness and soreness. Remind the patient to seek medical attention at onceafter any trauma.If the patient has ulcers and gangrene, enforce bed rest and use a paddedfootboard or bed cradle to prevent pressure from bed linens. Protect thefeet with soft padding. Wash them gently with a mild soap and tepid water,rinse thoroughly, and pat dry with a soft towel.Provide emotional support. If necessary, refer the patient forpsychological counseling to help the patient cope with restrictionsimposed by this chronic disease. If the patient has undergone amputation,assess rehabilitative needs, especially regarding changes in body image.Refer the patient to physical therapists, occupational therapists, and socialservice agencies, as needed. PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE",13,96
196,"Causes and Incidence PAD, referred to as arterial occlusive disease, is the obstruction omarrowing of the lumen of the aorta and its major branches, causing aninterruption of blood flow, usually to the legs and feet. PAD may affect thecarotid, vertebral, innominate, subclavian, mesenteric, and celiac arteries.Occlusions may be acute or chronic and commonly cause severe ischemia,skin ulceration, and gangrene.The prognosis depends on the occlusion s location, the development ofcollateral circulation to counteract reduced blood flow, and, in acute disease,the time elapsed between occlusion and its removal.Predisposing factors include smoking; aging; such conditions ashypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes; and a family history of vasculardisorders, MI, or stroke. PAD has no racial predilection. Men older than 50are at increased risk for intermittent claudication, a common sign of PAD.Pathophysiology PAD is a common complication of atherosclerosis. The occlusive mechanismmay be endogenous, due to emboli formation or thrombosis, or exogenous,due to trauma or fracture.Complications Severe ischemia Skin ulceration Gangrene Limb loss Signs and Symptoms The signs and symptoms of PAD depend on the site of the occlusion.

It s particularly usefulin chronic disease or for evaluating candidates for reconstructive surgery. Doppler ultrasonography and plethysmography are noninvasive tests thatshow decreased blood flow distal to the occlusion in acute disease. EEG and computed tomography scan may be necessary to rule out brainlesions. Ankle-brachial indices compare the systolic blood pressures between theupper and lower extremities and have been shown to be sensitive indetecting PAD.Treatment Treatment depends on the obstruction s cause, location, and size. For mildchronic disease, supportive measures include elimination of smoking,hypertension control, and walking exercise. For carotid artery occlusion,antiplatelet therapy may begin with clopidogrel and aspirin. For intermittentclaudication of chronic occlusive disease, cilostazol may improve bloodflow through the capillaries, particularly for patients who are poor",8,84
199,"candidates for surgery. Statin medications are used frequently, as well, tolessen the progression of atherosclerosis.Acute PAD usually requires surgery to restore circulation to the affectedarea, for example: Atherectomy Excision of plaque using a drill or slicing mechanism. Balloon angioplasty Compression of the obstruction using ballooninflation. Bypass graft Blood flow is diverted through an anastomosed autogenousor Dacron graft past the thrombosed segment. Combined therapy Concomitant use of any of the above treatments. Embolectomy A balloon-tipped Fogarty catheter is used to removethrombotic material from the artery. Embolectomy is used mainly formesenteric, femoral, or popliteal artery occlusion. Laser angioplasty Use of excision and hot-tipped lasers to vaporize theobstruction. Lumbar sympathectomy An adjunct to surgery, depending on thesympathetic nervous system s condition. Patch grafting Removal of the thrombosed arterial segment andreplacement with an autogenous vein or Dacron graft. Stents Insertion of a mesh of wires that stretch and mold to the arterialwall to prevent reocclusion. This follows laser angioplasty oratherectomy. Thromboendarterectomy Opening of the occluded artery and directremoval of the obstructing thrombus and the medial layer of the arterialwall; usually performed after angiography and commonly used withautogenous vein or Dacron bypass surgery (femoral-popliteal oraortofemoral). Thrombolytic therapy Lysis of any clot around or in the plaque byurokinase, streptokinase, or alteplase.Amputation becomes necessary with failure of arterial reconstructivesurgery or with the development of gangrene, persistent infection, orintractable pain.Other therapy includes heparin to prevent emboli (for embolic occlusion)and bowel resection after restoration of blood flow (for mesenteric arteryocclusion).",14,99
200,"Special Considerations Provide comprehensive patient teaching, including proper foot care.Explain diagnostic tests and procedures. Advise the patient to stopsmoking and to follow the prescribed medical regimen.Preoperatively, during an acute episode: Assess the patient s circulatory status by checking for the most distalpulses and by inspecting skin color and temperature. Provide pain relief as needed. Administer heparin by continuous I.V. drip as ordered. Use an infusionmonitor or pump to ensure the proper flow rate. Wrap the patient s affected foot in soft cotton batting, and reposition itfrequently to prevent pressure on any one area. Strictly avoid elevating orapplying heat to the affected leg. Watch for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and monitor intake andoutput for signs of renal failure (urine output 30 m L/hour). Ifthe patient has carotid, innominate, vertebral, or subclavian arteryocclusion, monitor for signs of stroke, such as numbness in an armor legand intermittent blindness.Postoperatively: Monitor the patient s vital signs. Continuously assess circulatory functionby inspecting skin color and temperature and by checking for distalpulses. In charting, compare earlier assessments and observations. Watchclosely for signs of hemorrhage (tachycardia and hypotension) and checkdressings for excessive bleeding. Incarotid, innominate, vertebral, or subclavian artery occlusion, assessneurologic status frequently for changes in LOC or muscle strength andpupil size. In mesenteric artery occlusion, connect the NG tube to low intermittentsuction. Monitor intake and output (low urine output may indicate damageto renal arteries during surgery). Check bowel sounds for retum ofperistalsis. Increasing abdominal distention and tendemess may indicateextension of bowel ischemia with resulting gangrene, necessitating furtherexcision, or it may indicate peritonitis. Insaddle block occlusion, check distal pulses for adequate circulation.Watch for signs of renal failure and mesenteric artery occlusion (severe",19,122
201,"abdominal pain), and for cardiac arrhythmias, which may precipitateembolus formation. Iniliac artery occlusion, monitor urine output for signs of renal failurefrom decreased perfusion to the kidneys as a result of surgery. Providemeticulous catheter care. In both femoral and popliteal artery occlusions, assist with earlyambulation, but discourage prolonged sitting. After amputation, check the patient s stump carefully for drainage; recordthe color and amount of damage, and the time. Elevate the stump asordered, and administer adequate analgesic medication. Because phantomlimb pain is common, explain this phenomenon to the patient. When preparing the patient for discharge, instruct the patient to watch forsigns of recurrence (pain, pallor, numbness, paralysis, and absence ofpulse) that can result from graft occlusion or occlusion at another site.Wam the patient against wearing constrictive clothing.SELECTED REFERENCESAmerican Heart Association.

204,"Air then enters the lungs in response to the pressure gradient between theatmosphere and the lungs. The lungs adhere to the chest wall and diaphragmbecause of the vacuum created within the pleural space. As the thoraxexpands, negative pressure is created in the intrapleural space, causing thelungs to also expand and draw in the warmed, humidified air. The accessorymuscles of inspiration, which include the scalene and stemocleidomastoidmuscles, raise the clavicles, upper ribs, and stemum. The accessory musclesaren t used in normal inspiration but may be used in some pathologicconditions.Normal expiration is passive; the inspiratory muscles cease to contract, thediaphragm rises, and the elastic recoil of the lungs causes the lungs tocontract. These actions raise the pressure within the lungs above atmosphericpressure, moving air from the lungs to the atmosphere. Active expirationcauses pleural pressure to become less negative.

To reach the capillary lumen, O, must cross thealveolocapillary membrane, which consists of an alveolar epithelial cell, athin interstitial space, the capillary basement membrane, and the capillaryendothelial cell membrane. The O, tension of air entering the respiratory tractis approximately 150 mm Hg. In the alveoli, inspired air mixes with CO, andwater vapor, lowering the O, pressure to approximately 100 mm Hg. Becausealveolar partial pressure of O, is higher than that present in mixed venousblood entering the pulmonary capillaries ( 40 mm Hg), O, diffuses across thealveolocapillary membrane into the blood.O, AND CO, TRANSPORT AND INTERNAL RESPIRATIONCirculating blood delivers O, to the cells of the body for metabolism andtransports metabolic wastes and CO, from the tissues back to the lungs. Whenoxygenated arterial blood reaches tissue capillaries, O, diffuses from the",12,77
206,"blood into the cells because of the O, tension gradient. The amount of O,available is determined by the concentration of hemoglobin (Hb; the principalcarrier of O,), the percentage of O, saturation of the Hb, regional blood flow,arterial O, content, and cardiac output.Intemal (cellular) respiration occurs as a part of cellular metabolism,which can take place with O, (aerobic) or without O, (anaerobic). The mostefficient method for providing fuel (high-energy compounds such as adenosinetriphosphate ATP ) for cellular reactions is aerobic metabolism, whichproduces CO, and water in addition to ATP. Anaerobic metabolism is lessefficient because a cell produces only a limited amount of ATP and yieldslactic acid as well as CO, as a metabolic by-product.Because circulation is continuous, CO, doesn t normally accumulate intissues. CO, produced during cellular respiration diffuses from tissues intoregional capillaries and is transported by systemic venous circulation. When CO, reaches the alveolar capillaries, it diffuses into the alveoli, where thepartial pressure of CO, is lower; CO, is removed from the alveoli duringexhalation.MECHANISMS OF CONTROLThe central nervous system s (CNS) control of respiration lies in therespiratory center, located in the lateral medulla oblongata of the brainstem.Impulses travel down the phrenic nerves to the diaphragm, and down theintercostal nerves to the intercostal muscles, where the impulses change therate and depth of respiration. The inspiratory and expiratory centers, locatedin the posterior medulla, establish the involuntary rhythm of the breathingpattem.Apneustic and pneumotaxic centers in the pons influence the pattem ofbreathing. Stimulation of the lower pontine apneustic center (e.g., by trauma,tumor, or stroke) produces forceful inspiratory gasps altemating with weakexpiration. The apneustic center continually excites the medullary inspiratorycenter and thus facilitates inspiration. Signals from the pneumotaxic center aswell as afferent impulses from the vagus nerve inhibit the apneustic center and tum off inspiration. The apneustic pattem doesn t occur if the vagus nervesare intact.Partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao,), p H, and p H of cerebrospinalfluid (CSF) influence output from the respiratory center.

207,"CSF, the p H of CSF falls, stimulating central chemoreceptors to increaseventilation.The respiratory center also receives information from peripheralchemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies. These chemoreceptorsrespond primarily to decreased Pao, but also to decreased p H. The peripheralchemoreceptors have little control over respirations until the Pao, is less than60 mm Hg.During exercise, stretch receptors in lung tissue and the diaphragm preventoverexpansion of the lungs. During swallowing, the cortex can interruptautomatic control of ventilation. During sleep, respiratory drive may fluctuate,producing hypoventilation and periods of apnea. Extemal sensations, drugs,chronic hypercapnia, and changes in body temperature can also alter therespiratory pattem.DIAGNOSTIC TESTSDiagnostic tests evaluate physiologic characteristics and pathologic stateswithin the respiratory tract.Noninvasive tests include: Chest X-ray shows such conditions as atelectasis, pleural effusion,infiltrates, pneumothorax, lesions, mediastinal shifts, pulmonary edema,and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Computed tomography (or CT) scan provides a three-dimensional picturethat s 100 times more sensitive than a chest X-ray.Magnetic resonance imaging identifies obstructed arteries and tissueperfusion, but movement of the heart and lungs reduces the image s clarity. Sputum specimen analysis assesses sputum quantity, color, viscosity, andodor; microbiological stains and culture of sputum can identify infectiousorganisms; and cytologic preparations can detect respiratory tractneoplasms. Sensitivity tests determine antibiotic sensitivity and resistance. Pulmonary function tests (or PFTs) measure lung volume, flow rates, andcompliance. Normal values, individualized by body stature, ethnicity, andage, are reported in percentage of the normal predicted value. Staticmeasurements are volume measurements that include tidal volume, volumeof air contained in a normal breath; functional residual capacity, volume ofair remaining in the lungs after normal expiration; vital capacity, volume ofair that can be exhaled after maximal inspiration; residual volume, airremaining in the lungs after maximal expiration; and total lung capacity",11,124
208,"(TLC), volume of air in the lungs after maximal inspiration. Dynamicmeasurements characterize the movement of air into and out of the lungsand show changes in lung mechanics. They include measurement of forcedexpiratory volume in 1 second (FEV,), maximum volume of air that can beexpired in second from TLC; maximal voluntary ventilation, volume ofair that can be expired in minute with the patient s maximum voluntaryeffort; and forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal volume of air that thepatient can exhale from TLC. (Peak flow rate, which can be obtained at thebedside, is also a dynamic measurement of pulmonary function.) Methacholine challenge is one method of assessing airway responsivenessand is used to determine a diagnosis of asthma. Exercise stress test evaluates the ability to transport O, and remove CO,with increasing metabolic demands.Polysomnography can diagnose sleep disorders. Lung scan (ventilation perfusion or scintiphotography scan) demonstratesventilation and perfusion pattems. It s used primarily to evaluatepulmonary embolus. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis assesses gas exchange. Decreased Pao,may indicate hypoventilation, ventilation perfusion mismatch, or shuntingof blood away from gas exchange sites. Increased partial pressure ofarterial carbon dioxide (Paco,) reflects marked ventilation perfusionmismatch or hypoventilation; decreased Paco, reflects increased alveolarventilation. Changes in p H may reflect metabolic or respiratorydysfunction. Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive assessment of arterial oxygen saturation. Capnography may be used either transcutaneously or in ventilator circuit todetermine Paco, trends.Invasive tests include: Bronchoscopy permits direct visualization of the trachea and mainstem,lobar, segmental, and subsegmental bronchi. It may be used to localize thesite of lung hemorrhage, visualize masses in these airways, and collectrespiratory tract secretions. Brush biopsy may be used to obtain specimensfrom the lungs for microbiological stains, culture, and cytology. Lesionbiopsies may be performed by using small forceps under directvisualization (when present in the proximal airways) or with the aid offluoroscopy (when present distal to regions of direct visualization).",17,118
209,"Bronchoscopy can also be used to clear secretions and remove foreignbodies. Thoracentesis permits removal of pleural fluid for analysis. Pleural biopsy obtains pleural tissue for histologic examination andculture. Pulmonary artery angiography, the injection of dye into the pulmonaryartery, can locate pulmonary embolism. This is considered the goldstandard for diagnosing pulmonary emboli. Positron emission tomography scan uses a short-life radionuclide.Increased uptake of the substance is seen in malignant cells.ASSESSMENTAssessment of the respiratory system begins with a thorough patient history.Ask the patient to describe his or her respiratory problem. How long has he orshe had it How long does each attack last Does one attack differ fromanother Does any activity in particular bring on an attack or make it worse What relieves the symptoms Always ask whether the patient was or is asmoker, what and how often he or she smoked or smokes, and how long he orshe smoked or has been smoking. Record this information in pack years thenumber of packs of cigarettes per day multiplied by the number of smokingyears. Remember to ask about the patient s occupation, hobbies, and travel;some of these activities may involve exposure to toxic or allergenicsubstances.If the patient has dyspnea, ask if it occurs during activity or at rest. Whatposition is the patient in when dyspnea occurs How far can he or she walk How many flights of stairs can he or she climb Has his or her exercisetolerance been decreasing Can he or she relate dyspnea to allergies orenvironmental conditions Does it occur only at night, during sleep If thepatient has a cough, ask about its severity, persistence, and duration; ask if itproduces sputum and, ifso, how much and what kind. Have the patient s coughhabits and character of sputum changed recently PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONUse inspection skills to check for clues to respiratory disease, beginning withthe patient s general appearance. If he or she is frail or cachectic, he or shemay have a chronic disease that has impaired his or her appetite. If he or sheis diaphoretic, restless, or irritable or protective of a painful body part, he or",13,99
210,"she may be in acute distress. Also, look for behavior changes that mayindicate hypoxemia or hypercapnia. Confusion, lethargy, bizarre behavior, orquiet sleep from which the patient can t be aroused may point to hypercapnia.Watch for marked cyanosis, indicated by bluish or ashen skin (usually bestseen on the lips, tongue, earlobes, and nail beds), which may be due tohypoxemia or poor tissue perfusion.Assess chest shape and symmetry at rest and during ventilation. Increasedanteroposterior diameter ( barrel chest ) characterizes emphysema.Kyphoscoliosis also alters chest configuration, which in tum restrictsbreathing. Assess respiratory excursion and observe for accessory muscle useduring breathing. The use of upper chest and neck muscles is normal onlyduring physical stress.Observe the rate and pattem of breathing because certain disorders producecharacteristic changes in breathing pattems. For example, an acute respiratorydisorder can produce tachypnea (rapid, shallow breathing) or hyperpnea(increased rate and depth of breathing); intracranial lesions can produce Cheyne-Stokes and Biot s respirations; increased intracranial pressure canresult in central hyperventilation and apneustic or ataxic breathing; metabolicdisorders can cause Kussmaul s respirations; and airway obstruction can leadto prolonged forceful expiration and pursed-lip breathing.Also observe posture and carriage. A patient with COPD, for example,usually supports rib cage movement by placing his or her arms on the sides ofa chair to increase expansion and lean forward during exhalation to helpexpel air.Palpation of the chest wall detects areas of tendemess, masses, changes infremitus (palpable vocal vibrations), or crepitus (air in subcutaneous tissues).To assess chest excursion and symmetry, place your hands in a horizontalposition, bilaterally on the posterior chest, with your thumbs pressed lightlyagainst the spine, creating folds in the skin. As the patient takes a deep breath,your thumbs should move quickly and equally away from the spine. Repeatthis with your hands placed anteriorly, at the costal margins (lower lobes) andclavicles (apices). Unequal movement indicates differences in expansion,seen in atelectasis, diaphragm or chest wall muscle disease, or splinting dueto pain.Percussion should detect resonance over lung fields that aren t covered bybony structures or the heart. A dull sound on percussion may meanconsolidation or pleural disease. (See Characterizing and interpretingpercussion sounds.)",13,132
211,"Characterizing and Interpreting Percussion Sounds Percussion may produce several kinds of sounds. Known as flat, dull,resonant, hyperresonant, or tympanic, these sounds indicate the locationand density of various structures. During percussion, determining othertonal characteristics, such as pitch, intensity, and quality, also will helpidentify respiratory structure. Use this chart as a guide to interpretingpercussion sounds. Characteristic Sound Pitch Intensity Quality Implications Flatness High Soft Extremely These sounds are normal over thedull stemum. Over the lung, they may indicateatelectasis or pleural effusion.Dullness Medium Medium Thudlike Normal over the liver, heart, anddiaphragm, these sounds over the lungmay point to pneumonia, tumor,atelectasis, or pleural effusion.Resonance Low Moderate Hollow When percussed over the lung, theseto loud sounds are normal.Hyperresonance Lower Very loud Booming These are normal findings with percussionthan over a child s lung. Over an adult s lung,resonance these findings may indicate emphysema,chronic bronchitis, asthma, orpneumothorax.Tympany High Loud Musical, Over the stomach, these are normaldrumlike findings; over the lung, they suggesttension pneumothorax.Auscultation normally detects soft, vesicular breath sounds throughout mostof the lung fields. Absent or adventitious breath sounds may indicate fluid insmall airways or interstitial lung disease (crackles), secretions in moderateand large airways (rhonchi), and airflow obstruction (wheezes).SPECIAL RESPIRATORY CAREThe hospitalized patient with respiratory disease may require an artificialupper airway, chest tubes, chest physiotherapy, and supervision of mechanicalventilation. In cardiopulmonary arrest, establishing an airway always takes",9,90
212,"precedence. In a patient with this condition, airway obstruction usually resultswhen the tongue slides back and blocks the posterior pharynx. The head-tiltmethod or, in suspected or confirmed cervical fracture or arthritis, the jaw-thrust maneuver can immediately push the tongue forward, relieving suchobstruction. Endotracheal (ET) intubation and, sometimes, a tracheotomy maybe necessary.CHEST TUBESAn important procedure in patients with respiratory disease is chest tubedrainage, which removes air or fluid from the pleural space. This allows thecollapsed lung to re-expand to fill the evacuated pleural space. Chest drainagealso allows removal of pleural fluid for culture. Chest tubes are commonlyused after thoracic surgery, penetrating chest wounds, pleural effusion, andempyema. They re also used for evacuation of pneumothorax, hydrothorax, orhemothorax. Sometimes chest tubes are used to instill sclerosing drugs into thepleural space to prevent recurrent malignant pleural effusions.Commonly, the chest tube is placed in the sixth or seventh intercostal space,in the axillary region. Occasionally, in pneumothorax, the tube is placed in thesecond or third intercostal space, in the midclavicular region.Follow these guidelines when caring for a patient with a chest tube: Monitor changes in suction pressure. Make sure that all connections in the system are tight and secured withtape. Never clamp the chest tube unless checking for air leaks or changing thedrainage system. Record the amount, color, and consistency of drainage. Watch for signs ofshock, such as tachycardia and hypotension, if drainage is excessive. Encourage the patient to cough and breathe deeply every hour to enhancelung expansion.Additionally, if a water seal wet suction system is in place: Check for fluctuation in the water-seal chamber as the patient breathes.Normal fluctuations of 2 to 4 (about 5 to 10 cm) reflect pressure changesin the pleural space during respiration. Watch for intermittent bubbling in the water-seal chamber. This bubblingoccurs normally when the system is removing air from the pleural cavity.Absence of bubbling indicates that the pleural space has sealed.",17,114
213,"Check the water level in the suction-control chamber. If necessary, addsterile water to bring the level to the ordered level. Check for gentle bubbling in the suction-control chamber, which indicatesthat the proper suction level has been reached.If a dry-suction system is in place, check that the rotary dry-suction controldial is tumed to the ordered suction mark and verify that the appropriateindicator is present, indicating that the desired amount of suction is applied.VENTILATOR METHODSMechanical ventilators are typically used for CNS problems, hypoxemia, orfailure of the normal bellows action provided by the diaphragm and rib cage.Positive-pressure ventilators cause inspiration while increasing tidal volume(V,). The inspiratory cycles of these ventilators may vary in volume, pressure,time, or frequency. For example, a volume-cycled ventilator the type mostcommonly used delivers a preset volume of air each time, regardless of theamount of lung resistance. A pressure-cycled ventilator generates flow untilthe machine reaches a preset pressure regardless of the volume delivered orthe time required to achieve the pressure. A time-cycled ventilator generatesflow for a preset amount of time. A high-frequency ventilator uses highrespiratory rates and low V, to maintain alveolar ventilation. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used to retain a certain amount of pressure inthe lungs at the end of expiration. By keeping small airways and alveoli openwith this method, functional residual capacity is increased and oxygenation isimproved.Implement strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) andplan to remove the patient from ventilator support as soon as the cause ofrespiratory failure has resolved. (See Preventing ventilator-associatedpneumonia, page 92.) Several weaning methods are used. The patient may betaken off the ventilator and supplied with a T-piece (ET tube O, adapter) thatprovides O, and humidification. The patient then breathes spontaneouslywithout the ventilator for gradually increasing periods.PREVENTIONPREVENTING VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATEDPNEUMONIA",14,95
214,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of deathamong all hospital-acquired infections. VAP also prolongs time spent onthe ventilator, length of critical care unit (CCU) stay, and length of hospitalstay after discharge from the CCU. Research has shown that the mortalityrate due to VAP can be reduced by early recognition of pneumonia andconsistent application of evidence-based practices. The Ventilator Bundleis a group of interventions related to ventilator care that, whenimplemented together, achieve significantly better outcomes than whenimplemented individually. The key components of the Ventilator Bundleinclude: elevating the head of the bed 30 to 45 degrees interrupting sedation daily and assessing the readiness to extubateinstituting peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis instituting deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis providing daily oral care with chlorhexidine Various other best practices can be combined with the bundle to prevent VAP. They include: adhering to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or World Health Organization hand hygiene guidelines to prevent the spread ofinfection using noninvasive ventilatory support, such as bilevel positive-airwayventilation instead of endotracheal (ET) intubation and mechanicalventilation, to eliminate the risk of VAPusing the oral route instead of the nasal route for ET intubation toprevent sinusitis maintaining ET tube cuff pressure at 20 cm or more to preventaspiration using a cuffed ET tube with in-line and subglottic suctioning to preventsecretion aspiration avoiding gastric distention to reduce the risk for aspiration avoiding unexplained extubation and reintubation to prevent secretionaspirationminimizing equipment contamination (by removing condensate fromventilator circuits, keeping the circuit closed during removal, changingthe ventilator circuit only when visibly soiled or malfunctioning, and",6,88
215,"disinfecting and storing respiratory equipment properly) to preventairway contamination teaching the patient and family about measures to prevent VAP andinvolving them in monitoring With intermittent mandatory ventilation, the ventilator provides a specificnumber of breaths, and the patient is able to breathe spontaneously betweenventilator breaths. The frequency of ventilator breaths is gradually decreaseduntil the patient can breathe on his or her own. Pressure support ventilation, inwhich the patient receives a preset pressure boost with each spontaneousbreath, has proved effective. Vital signs, ABG levels, physical findings, andsubjective symptoms should be monitored periodically during weaning toassess respiratory status.Chest Physiotherapy In respiratory conditions marked by excessive accumulation of secretions inthe lungs, chest physiotherapy may enhance removal of secretions. Chestphysiotherapy includes chest assessment, effective breathing and coughingexercises, postural drainage, percussion, vibration, and evaluation of thetherapy s effectiveness. Before initiating treatment, review X-rays andphysical assessment findings to locate areas of secretions. Deep breathing maintains diaphragm use, increases negative intrathoracicpressure, and promotes venous retum; it s especially important when painor dressings restrict chest movement. An incentive spirometer can providepositive visual reinforcement to promote deep breathing. Pursed-lip breathing is used primarily in obstructive disease to slowexpiration and prevent small airway collapse. Such breathing slows airthrough smaller bronchi, maintaining positive pressure and preventingcollapse of small airways and resultant air trapping. Segmental breathing or lateral costal breathing is used after lung resectionand for localized disorders. Place your hand over the lung area on theaffected side. Instruct the patient to try to push that portion of the chestagainst your hand on deep inspiration. You should be able to feel this withyour hand. Coughing that s controlled and staged gradually increases intrathoracicpressure, reducing pain and bronchospasm of explosive coughing. When",16,109
216,"wound pain prevents effective coughing, splint the wound with a pillow,towel, or your hand during coughing exercises. Postural drainage uses gravity to drain secretions into larger airways,where they can be expectorated. This technique is used in the patient withcopious or tenacious secretions. Before performing postural drainage,auscultate the patient s chest and review chest X-rays to determine the bestposition for maximum drainage. To prevent vomiting, schedule posturaldrainage at least 1 hour after meals. Percussion moves air against the chest wall, enhancing the effectiveness ofpostural drainage by loosening lung secretions. Percussion iscontraindicated in severe pain, extreme obesity, cancer that hasmetastasized to the ribs, crushing chest injuries, bleeding disorders,spontaneous pneumothorax, spinal compression fractures, and in patientswith temporary pacemakers. Vibration can be used with percussion or alone when percussion iscontraindicated. PEEP therapy maintains positive pressure in airways, preventing smallairway collapse.Before and after chest physiotherapy, auscultate the patient s lung fields andassess for sputum production to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy.Congenital and Pediatric Disorders RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROMERespiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also called hyaline membrane disease,is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. In the United States alone, itkills 40,000 neonates every year. RDS occurs in premature neonates and, ifuntreated, is fatal within 72 hours of birth in up to 14 of neonates weighingless than 5 lb (2.5 kg). Aggressive management using mechanical ventilationcan improve the prognosis, but some surviving neonates may develop somedegree of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).Causes and Incidence Although airways and alveoli of a neonate s respiratory system are present by27 weeks gestation, the intercostal muscles are weak, and the alveolarcapillary system is immature. The preterm neonate with RDS develops",13,108
217,"widespread alveolar collapse because of a lack of surfactant, a lipoproteinpresent in alveoli and respiratory bronchioles. The surfactant lowers surfacetension and helps prevent alveolar collapse. This surfactant deficiency resultsin widespread atelectasis, which leads to inadequate alveolar ventilation withshunting of blood through collapsed areas of lung, causing hypoxemia andacidosis.RDS occurs almost exclusively in neonates bom before 37 weeks gestation (in 60 of those bom before the 28th week). The incidence isgreatest in those with birth weights of 1,000 to 1,500 g. Infants of diabeticmothers, those bom by cesarean delivery, second-bom twins, infants withperinatal asphyxia, and those delivered suddenly after antepartum hemorrhageare more commonly affected.Pathophysiology The lack of surfactant coating the alveoli reduces the available pulmonarysurface and decreases the area for gas exchange. Worsening hypercapnia andhypoxia cause metabolic and respiratory acidosis leading to pulmonaryvasoconstriction and peripheral vasodilation. Damage to the endothelial andalveolar cells results from the ongoing hypoxia. The subsequent vasculardisruption leads to plasma leakage into the alveolar spaces, layering of fibrinand necrotic cells creating hyaline membranes. These membranes impede theexchange of gases across the alveolar surface.Complications Pneumothorax Pneumomediastinum Pneumopericardium BPD Intraventricular bleed Hemorrhage into lungs after surfactant use Retinopathy of prematurity (or ROP)Delayed mental development or mental retardation Signs and Symptoms Although a neonate with RDS may breathe normally at first, they usuallydevelop rapid, shallow respirations within minutes or hours of birth, withintercostal, subcostal, or stemal retractions; nasal flaring; and audible",8,92
218,"expiratory grunting. This grunting is a natural compensatory mechanismdesigned to produce PEEP and prevent further alveolar collapse.Severe disease is marked by apnea, bradycardia, and cyanosis (fromhypoxemia, left-to-right shunting through the foramen ovale, or right-to-leftintrapulmonary shunting through atelectatic regions of the lung). Other clinicalfeatures include pallor, frothy sputum, and low body temperature as a result ofan immature nervous system and the absence of subcutaneous fat.Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Signs of respiratory distress in a prematureneonate during the first few hours of life strongly suggest RDS, but achest X-ray and ABG analysis are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Chest X-ray may be normal for the first 6 to 12 hours (in 50 of neonateswith RDS), but 24 hours after birth it will show the characteristic ground-glass appearance and air bronchograms. ABG analysis shows decreased Pao,; normal, decreased, or increased Paco,; and decreased p H (from respiratory or metabolic acidosis or both). Chest auscultation reveals normal or diminished air entry and crackles(rare in early stages).When a cesarean birth is necessary before 36 weeks gestation,amniocentesis enables the determination of the lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S)ratio and the presence of phosphatidylglycerol. An L/S ratio of more than 2:1and the presence of phosphatidylglycerol decrease the likelihood of RDS.Treatment Treatment of an infant with RDS requires vigorous respiratory support. Warm,humidified, oxygen-enriched gases are administered by oxygen hood or, ifsuch treatment fails, by mechanical ventilation. Severe cases may requiremechanical ventilation with PEEP or continuous positive-airway pressure(CPAP), administered by nasal prongs or, when necessary, ET intubation.Special ventilation techniques are now used on the patient s refractory toconventional mechanical ventilation. These include high-frequency jetventilation and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. Extracorporealmembrane oxygenation is the last choice for ventilation and is only availablein certain specialized facilities. Treatment of RDS also includes:",12,102
219,"aradiant warmer or isolette for thermoregulation LV. fluids and sodium bicarbonate to control acidosis and maintain fluidand electrolyte balance tube feedings or total parenteral nutrition if the neonate is too weak to eat administration of surfactant by an ET tube (Studies show that this treatmentcan prevent or improve the course of RDS as well as reduce mortality.)Special Considerations Neonates with RDS require continual assessment and monitoring in anintensive care nursery. Closely monitor ABGs as well as fluid intake and output. If the neonate hasan umbilical catheter (arterial or venous), check for arterial hypotension orabnormal central venous pressure. Watch for complications, such asinfection, thrombosis, or decreased circulation to the legs. If the neonatehas a transcutaneous oxygen monitor, change the site of the lead placementevery 2 to 4 hours. To evaluate progress, assess skin color, rate and depth of respirations,severity of retractions, nostril flaring, frequency of expiratory grunting,frothing at the lips, and restlessness. Regularly assess the effectiveness of oxygen or ventilator therapy. Evaluateevery change in fraction of inspired oxygen and PEEP or CPAP bymonitoring arterial oxygen saturation or ABG levels. Adjust the PEEP or CPAP as indicated, on the basis of findings. Mechanical ventilation in neonates is usually done in a pressure-limitedmode rather than in the volume-limited mode used in adults.When the neonate is on mechanical ventilation, watch carefully for signs ofbarotrauma (an increase in respiratory distress and subcutaneousemphysema) and accidental disconnection from the ventilator. Checkventilator settings frequently. Be alert for signs of complications of PEEPor CPAP therapy, such as decreased cardiac output, pneumothorax, andpneumomediastinum. Mechanical ventilation increases the risk of infectionin the preterm neonate, so preventive measures are essential. As needed, arrange for follow-up care with a neonatal ophthalmologist tocheck for retinal damage. Preterm neonates in an oxygen-rich environmentare at increased risk for developing ROP. Teach the parents about their neonate s condition and, if possible, let themparticipate in their care (using sterile technique), to encourage normal",18,119
220,"parent-infant bonding. Advise parents that full recovery may take up to 12months. When the prognosis is poor, prepare the parents for the neonate simpending death and offer emotional support. Help reduce mortality in the neonate with RDS by detecting respiratorydistress early. Recognize intercostal retractions and grunting, especially ina premature neonate, as signs of RDS; make sure the neonate receivesimmediate treatment. : PREVENTION Prenatal care can help prevent prematurity. Give corticosteroids to the mother 2 to 3 days before delivery to help theinfant s lungs mature in preterm deliveries.SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROMEA medical mystery of early infancy, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS),also called crib death, is the unexpected, sudden death of an infant or childyounger than age year. Reasons for the death remain unexplained even afteran autopsy. Typically, parents put the infant to bed and later find him or herdead, commonly with no indications of a struggle or distress of any kind.Incidence has decreased with the practice of teaching parents to place aninfant on their back to sleep.Causes and Incidence SIDS is the third leading cause of death in infants between 1 month and 1 yearold. It occurs more commonly in winter months. The incidence is higher inmales, preterm neonates, and those who sleep on their stomachs or in cribswith soft bedding. Incidence is also higher among neonates bom in conditionsof poverty and to those who were one ofa single multiple birth, such as twinsand triplets, and to mothers who smoke, take drugs, or failed to seek prenatalcare until late in the pregnancy. SIDS may also result from an abnormality inthe control of ventilation that allows CO, to build up in the blood, therebycausing prolonged apneic periods with profound hypoxemia and seriouscardiac arrhythmias. It s also thought to be associated with problems in sleeparousal.Pathophysiology",14,102
221,"Although the exact pathophysiology of SIDS is not known, there is a commontheory. Abnormalities of the autoimmune nervous system and brainstem causedysfunctions of breathing. Episodes of hypoxia contribute to delaying thearousal response when oxygen availability is decreased and potentiallyleading to death.Signs and Symptoms Although parents find some victims wedged in crib comers or with blanketswrapped around their heads, autopsies rule out suffocation as the cause ofdeath. Autopsy shows a patent airway, so aspiration of vomitus isn t the causeof death. Typically, SIDS babies don t cry out and show no signs of havingbeen disturbed in their sleep. However, their positions or tangled blanketsmay suggest movement just before death, perhaps due to terminal spasm.Depending on how long the infant has been dead, a SIDS baby may have amottled complexion with extreme cyanosis of the lips and fingertips orpooling of blood in the legs and feet that may be mistaken for bruises. Pulseand respirations are absent, and the diaper is wet and full of stool.Diagnosis Diagnosis of SIDS requires an autopsy to rule out other causes of death.Characteristic histologic findings on autopsy include small or normal adrenalglands and petechiae over the visceral surfaces of the pleura, within thethymus, and in the epicardium. Autopsy also reveals extremely well-preserved lymphoid structures and certain pathologic characteristics thatsuggest chronic hypoxemia such as increased pulmonary artery smoothmuscle. Examination also shows edematous, congestive lungs fully expandedin the pleural cavities, liquid (not clotted) blood in the heart, and curd fromthe stomach inside the trachea.Treatment If the parents bring the infant to the emergency department (ED), the physicianwill decide whether to try to resuscitate him. An aborted SIDS infant is onewho s found apneic and is successfully resuscitated. Such an infant, or anyinfant who had a sibling stricken by SIDS, should be tested for infantile apnea.If tests are positive, a home apnea monitor may be recommended. Because theinfant usually can t be resuscitated, however, treatment focuses on providingemotional support for the family.",12,110
222,"Special Considerations Sa Make sure that parents are present when the child s death is announced.They may lash out at ED personnel, the babysitter, or anyone else involvedin the child s care even each other. Stay calm and let them express theirfeelings. Reassure them that they weren t to blame.Let the parents see the baby ina private room. Allow them to express theirgrief in their own way. Stay in the room with them if appropriate. Offer tocall clergy, friends, or relatives.After the parents and family have recovered from their initial shock,explain the necessity for an autopsy to confirm the diagnosis of SIDS (insome states, this is mandatory). At this time, provide the family with somebasic facts about SIDS and encourage them to give their consent for theautopsy. Make sure that they receive the autopsy report promptly.Find out whether your community has a local counseling and informationprogram for SIDS parents. Participants in such a program will contact theparents, ensure that they receive the autopsy report promptly, put them intouch with a professional counselor, and maintain supportive telephonecontact. Also, find out whether there s a local SIDS parent group; suchagroup can provide significant emotional support. Contact the National Sudden Infant Death Foundation for information about such local groups.If your facility s policy is to assign a public health nurse to the family, theywill provide the continuing reassurance and assistance the parents willneed.If the parents decide to have another child, they Il need information andcounseling to help them through the pregnancy and the first year of the newinfant s life.Infants at high risk for SIDS may be placed on apnea monitoring at home.All new parents should be informed of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that infants be positioned on their back, not ontheir stomach or side, for sleeping.TITIIis M PREVENTION Tell parents to place infants on their backs to sleep.Tell parents infants should sleep on a firm mattress and shouldnt havesoft objects in the crib; like stuffed toys and blankets.Tell parents infants shouldn t sleep in the same bed as their parents.",11,101

Tell parents infants shouldn t be exposed to secondhand smoke.CROUPCroup is a severe inflammation and obstruction of the upper airway, occurringas acute laryngotracheobronchitis (most common), laryngitis, and acutespasmodic laryngitis; it must always be distinguished from epiglottitis. It sderived from an old German word for voice box and refers to swellingaround the larynx or vocal cords. Recovery is usually complete.Causes and Incidence Croup usually results from a viral infection but can also be caused bybacteria, allergens, and inhaled irritants. Parainfluenza viruses cause 75 ofsuch infections; adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza,and measles viruses account for the rest.Croup is a childhood disease affecting more boys than girls (typicallybetween 3 months and 5 years old) that usually occurs during the winter. Up to15 of patients have a strong family history of croup.Pathophysiology Infection of the laryngeal mucosa leads to edema and inflammation of theepiglottal area. This swelling leads to a narrowing of the airway andincreasingly deep respirations. The ongoing effort to breath as the narrowingprogresses becomes more difficult and the air flowing through the upperairway becomes turbulent. During inspiration, the flexible chest wall caves inslightly and causing paradoxical breathing.Complications Respiratory distress Respiratory arrest Epiglottitis Bacterial tracheitis Atelectasis Dehydration Signs and Symptoms",9,78
224,"The onset of croup usually follows an upper respiratory tract infection.Clinical features include inspiratory stridor, hoarse or muffled vocal sounds,varying degrees of laryngeal obstruction and respiratory distress, and acharacteristic sharp, barking, seal-like cough. These symptoms may last only afew hours or persist for a day or two. As it progresses, croup causesinflammatory edema and, possibly, spasm, which can obstruct the upperairway and severely compromise ventilation. (See How croup affects theupper airway.)PATHOPHYSIOLOGYHOW CROUP AFFECTS THE UPPER AIRWAYIn croup, inflammatory swelling and spasms constrict the larynx,thereby reducing airflow. This cross-sectional drawing (from chin tochest) shows the upper airway changes caused by croup. Inflammatorychanges almost completely obstruct the larynx (which includes theepiglottis) and significantly narrow the trachea.",7,35
225,"Inflamed laryngealarea Inflamed subglottictissue Narrowed trachea Each form of croup has additional characteristics:In laryngotracheobronchitis, the symptoms seem to worsen at night.Inflammation causes edema of the bronchi and bronchioles as well asincreasingly difficult expiration that frightens the child. Other characteristicfeatures include fever, diffusely decreased breath sounds, expiratory rhonchi,and scattered crackles.Laryngitis, which results from vocal cord edema, is usually mild andproduces no respiratory distress except in infants. Early signs include a sorethroat and cough, which, rarely, may progress to marked hoarseness,suprastemal and intercostal retractions, inspiratory stridor, dyspnea,diminished breath sounds, restlessness and, in later stages, severe dyspneaand exhaustion.Acute spasmodic laryngitis affects a child between 1 and 3 years old,particularly one with allergies and a family history of croup. It typicallybegins with mild to moderate hoarseness and nasal discharge, followed by the",4,53
226,"characteristic cough and noisy inspiration (that usually awaken the child atnight), labored breathing with retractions, rapid pulse, and clammy skin. Thechild understandably becomes anxious, which may lead to increasing dyspneaand transient cyanosis. These severe symptoms diminish after several hoursbut reappear in a milder form on the next one or two nights.Diagnosis The clinical picture is very characteristic, so the diagnosis should besuspected immediately. When bacterial infection is the cause, throat culturesmay identify the organisms and their sensitivity to antibiotics and rule outdiphtheria. On a posterior anterior X-ray of the chest, narrowing of the upperairway ( steeple sign ) may be apparent. Laryngoscopy may revealinflammation and obstruction in epiglottal and laryngeal areas. In evaluatingthe patient, assess for foreign body obstruction (a common cause of crouplikecough in a young child) as well as masses and cysts.Treatment For most children with croup, home care with rest, cool mist humidificationduring sleep, and antipyretics, such as acetaminophen, relieve symptoms.However, respiratory distress that s severe or interferes with oral hydrationrequires hospitalization and parenteral fluid replacement to preventdehydration. If bacterial infection is the cause, antibiotic therapy is necessary.Oxygen therapy may also be required. Increasing obstruction of the airwayrequires intubation and mechanical ventilation.Inhaled racemic epinephrine and corticosteroids may be used to alleviaterespiratory distress.Special Considerations Monitor and support respiration, and control fever. Because croup is sofrightening to the child and family, you must also provide support andreassurance. Carefully monitor cough and breath sounds, hoarseness, severity ofretractions, inspiratory stridor, cyanosis, respiratory rate and character(especially prolonged and labored respirations), restlessness, fever, andcardiac rate.",11,93
227,"Keep the child as quiet as possible. However, avoid sedation because itmay depress respiration. If the patient is an infant, position them in aninfant seat or propped up with a pillow; place an older child in Fowler sposition. If an older child requires a cool mist tent to help them breathe,explain why it s needed. Isolate patients suspected of having RSV and parainfluenza infections ifpossible. Wash your hands carefully before leaving the room, to avoidtransmission to other children, particularly infants. Instruct parents andothers involved in the care of these children to take similar precautions. Control fever with sponge baths and antipyretics. Keep a hypothermiablanket on hand for temperatures above 102 F (38.9 C). Watch forseizures in infants and young children with high fevers. Give IV.antibiotics as ordered. Relieve sore throat with soothing, water-based ices, such as fruit sherbetand ice pops. Avoid thicker, milk-based fluids if the child is producingheavy mucus or has great difficulty in swallowing. Apply petroleum jellyor another ointment around the nose and lips to soothe irritation from nasaldischarge and mouth breathing. Maintain a calm, quiet environment and offer reassurance. Explain allprocedures and answer any questions.When croup doesn t require hospitalization: Teach the parents effective home care. Suggest the use of a cool misthumidifier (vaporizer). To relieve croupy spells, tell parents to carry thechild into the bathroom, shut the door, and tum on the hot water. Breathingin warm, moist air quickly eases an acute spell of croup. Wam parents that ear infections and pneumonia are complications of croup,which may appear about 5 days after recovery. Stress the importance ofimmediately reporting earache, productive cough, high fever, or increasedshortness of breath.HITEM PREVENTION Perform hand hygiene frequently to prevent a respiratory infection. Give diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (Dp T); Haemophilus influenzae B(Hib); and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines to children.",22,117
228,"EPIGLOTTITISAcute epiglottitis is an acute inflammation of the epiglottis that tends to causeairway obstruction. A critical emergency, epiglottitis can prove fatal unlessit s recognized and treated promptly.Causes and Incidence Epiglottitis usually results from infection with Hib and, occasionally,pneumococci and group A streptococci. It typically strikes children between 2and 6 years old. (However, immunosuppression can predispose adults toepiglottitis.) Since the advent of the Hib vaccine, epiglottitis is becomingmore rare.Pathophysiology The causative bacteria invade the mucosa and into the bloodstream causingbacteremia and infection of the epiglottis as well as surrounding tissues.Acute inflammation and edema begin in the epiglottic area and progressing tothe epiglottic folds, arytenoids, and entire supraglottic larynx. The aggressiveswelling and edema greatly reduces the available airway and quicklyincreasing the risk for a respiratory crisis.Complications Respiratory failure Pneumonia Meningitis Death Pericarditis Signs And Symptoms Sometimes preceded by an upper respiratory infection, epiglottitis mayrapidly progress to complete upper airway obstruction within 2 to 5 hours.Laryngeal obstruction results from inflammation and edema of the epiglottis.Accompanying symptoms include high fever, stridor, sore throat, dysphagia,irritability, restlessness, and drooling. To relieve severe respiratory distress,the child with epiglottitis may hyperextend his or her neck, sit up, and leanforward with his or her mouth open, tongue protruding, and nostrils flaring as",7,86
229,"he or she tries to breathe. The child may develop inspiratory retractions andrhonchi.Diagnosis In acute epiglottitis, throat examination reveals a large, edematous, bright redepiglottis. Such examination should follow lateral neck X-rays and, generally,shouldnt be performed if the suspected obstruction is great. Specialequipment (laryngoscope and ET tubes) should be available because a tongueblade can cause sudden complete airway obstruction. Trained personnel (suchas an anesthesiologist) should be on hand during the throat examination tosecure an emergency airway. On the lateral soft-tissue X-ray of the neck, alarge, thick but indistinct ( thumbprint ) epiglottis will be seen. Blood orthroat culture may show H. influenzae or other bacteria.Treatment A child with acute epiglottitis and airway obstruction requires emergencyhospitalization; the child may need emergency ET intubation or a tracheotomywith subsequent monitoring in an intensive care unit. Respiratory distress thatinterferes with swallowing necessitates parenteral fluid administration toprevent dehydration. A patient with acute epiglottitis should always receive acomplete course of parenteral antibiotics usually a second- or third-generation cephalosporin. (If the child is allergic to penicillin, a quinolone orsulfa drug may be substituted.) Corticosteroids should be used to decreaseswelling of the throat.Special Considerations Keep equipment available in case of sudden complete airway obstructionto secure an airway. Be prepared to assist with intubation or tracheotomy,as necessary.ALERT Watch for increasing restlessness, rising cardiac rate, fever,dyspnea, and retractions, which may indicate the need for anemergency tracheotomy. Monitor blood gases for hypoxemia andhypercapnia. After a tracheotomy, anticipate the patient s needs because they won t beable to cry or call out; provide emotional support. Reassure the patient and",15,89
230,"their family that the tracheotomy is a short-term intervention (usually from4 to 7 days). Monitor the patient for rising temperature and pulse rate andhypotension signs of secondary infection. The bacterial infection causing epiglottitis is contagious, and airbome ordroplet precautions should be followed. Family members should bescreened.HITE PREVENTION Perform hand hygiene frequently to prevent infections. Administer the Hib vaccine to children.Acute Disorders ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROMEA form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that causes acute respiratoryfailure (ARF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also called shocklung or adult respiratory distress syndrome, results from increasedpermeability of the alveolocapillary membrane. Fluid accumulates in the lunginterstitium, alveolar spaces, and small airways, causing the lung to stiffen.Effective ventilation is thus impaired, prohibiting adequate oxygenation ofpulmonary capillary blood. Severe ARDS can cause intractable and fatalhypoxemia. However, patients who recover may have little or no permanentlung damage. (See Alveolar changes in ARDS.)PATHOPHYSIOLOGYALVEOLAR CHANGES IN ARDSThe alveoli undergo major changes in each phase of ARDS. Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3In phase 7, injury reduces normal In phase 2, those substances _In phase 3, as capillaryblood flow to the lungs.

232,"hydrocarbon and paraquat ingestion pancreatitis, uremia, or miliary tuberculosis (TB; rare) near drowning severe traumatic injuries, such as head injury or pulmonary contusions Altered permeability of the alveolocapillary membrane causes fluid toaccumulate in the interstitial space. If the pulmonary lymphatic glands can tremove this fluid, interstitial edema develops. The fluid collects in theperibronchial and peribronchiolar spaces, producing bronchiolar narrowing.Hypoxemia occurs as a result of fluid accumulation in alveoli and subsequentalveolar collapse, causing the shunting of blood through nonventilated lungregions. In addition, alveolar collapse causes a dramatic increase in lungcompliance, which makes it more difficult to achieve adequate ventilation.ARDS affects 10 to 14 people per 100,000, with a mortality rate of 36 to52 .Pathophysiology An acute lung injury can begin the cascade of alveolar damage resulting in analtered permeability of the epithelial barrier and subsequent pulmonaryedema. Diffuse alveolar damage progresses and granulation tissue forms inthe alveolar spaces creating fibrosis. This fibrotic phase inhibits lungcompliance and effective respiration.Complications Multisystem failure Pulmonary fibrosis Pneumothorax Signs and Symptoms ARDS initially produces rapid, shallow breathing and dyspnea within hoursto days of the initial injury (sometimes after the patient s condition appears tohave stabilized). Hypoxemia develops, causing an increased drive forventilation. Because of the effort required to expand the stiff lung, intercostaland suprastemal retractions result. Fluid accumulation produces crackles andrhonchi; worsening hypoxemia causes restlessness, apprehension, mentalsluggishness, motor dysfunction, and tachycardia (possibly with transientincreased arterial blood pressure).",9,91
233,"ELDER TIP The older patient may appear to do well following an initial3 episode of ARDS. Symptoms commonly appear 2 to 3 days later.Severe ARDS causes overwhelming hypoxemia. If uncorrected, this resultsin hypotension, decreasing urine output, respiratory and metabolic acidosis,and eventually ventricular fibrillation or standstill.Diagnosis On room air, ABG analysis initially shows decreased Pao, (less than 60 mm Hg) and Paco, (less than 35 mm Hg). The resulting p H usually reflectsrespiratory alkalosis. As ARDS becomes more severe, ABG analysis showsrespiratory acidosis (increasing Paco, more than 45 mm Hg ), metabolicacidosis (decreasing bicarbonate less than 22 m Eq/L ), and a decreasing Pao, despite oxygen therapy.Other diagnostic tests include the following: Pulmonary artery catheterization helps identify the cause of pulmonaryedema (cardiac versus noncardiac) by evaluating pulmonary artery wedgepressure (PAWP); allows collection of pulmonary artery blood, whichshows decreased oxygen saturation, reflecting tissue hypoxia; measurespulmonary artery pressure (PAP); measures cardiac output bythermodilution techniques; and provides information to allow calculationof the percentage of blood shunted through the lungs. Serial chest X-rays initially show bilateral infiltrates. In later stages, aground-glass appearance and eventually (as hypoxemia becomesirreversible), whiteouts of both lung fields are apparent. Medicalpersonnel can differentiate ARDS from heart failure by noting thefollowing on serial chest X-rays: normal cardiac silhouette diffuse bilateral infiltrates that tend to be more peripheral and patchy, asopposed to the usual perihilar bat wing appearance of cardiogenicpulmonary edema fewer pleural effusions Differential diagnosis must rule out cardiogenic pulmonary edema,pulmonary vasculitis, and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. To establish theetiology, laboratory work should include sputum Gram stain, culture andsensitivity tests, and blood cultures to detect infections; a toxicology screen",9,98
234,"for drug ingestion; and, when pancreatitis is a consideration, a serum amylasedetermination.Treatment When possible, treatment is designed to correct the underlying cause of ARDSas well as to prevent progression and the potentially fatal complications ofhypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. Supportive medical care consists ofadministering humidified oxygen with CPAP. Hypoxemia that doesn t respondadequately to these measures requires ventilatory support with intubation,volume ventilation, and PEEP. Other supportive measures include fluidrestriction, diuretics, and correction of electrolyte and acid baseabnormalities.When ARDS requires mechanical ventilation, sedatives, opioids, omeuromuscular blocking agents may be ordered to optimize ventilation.Treatment to reverse severe metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate maybe necessary, although in severe cases this may worsen the acidosis if CO,can t be cleared adequately. Use of fluids and vasopressors may be requiredto maintain blood pressure. Infections require appropriate anti-infectivetherapy.Special Considerations ARDS requires careful monitoring and supportive care. Frequently assess the patient s respiratory status. Be alert for retractions oninspiration. Note the rate, rhythm, and depth of respirations; watch fordyspnea and the use of accessory muscles of respiration. On auscultation,listen for adventitious or diminished breath sounds. Check for clear, frothysputum, which may indicate pulmonary edema. Observe and document the hypoxemic patient s neurologic status (level ofconsciousness and mental status). Maintain a patent airway by suctioning, using sterile, nontraumatictechnique. Ensure adequate humidification to help liquefy tenacioussecretions. Closely monitor heart rate and blood pressure. Watch for arrhythmias thatmay result from hypoxemia, acid base disturbances, or electrolyteimbalance. With pulmonary artery catheterization, know the desiredpressure levels. Check readings often and watch for decreasing mixedvenous oxygen saturation.",18,100
235,"Monitor serum electrolytes and correct imbalances. Measure intake andoutput; weigh the patient daily. Check ventilator settings frequently, and empty condensate from tubingpromptly to ensure maximum oxygen delivery. Monitor ABG studies andpulse oximetry. The patient with severe hypoxemia may need controlledmechanical ventilation with positive pressure. Give sedatives, as needed,to reduce restlessness.Because PEEP may decrease cardiac output, check for hypotension,tachycardia, and decreased urine output. Suction only as needed tomaintain PEEP or use an in-line suctioning apparatus. Reposition thepatient often and record an increase in secretions, temperature, orhypotension that may indicate a deteriorating condition. Monitor peakpressures during ventilation. Because of stiff, noncompliant lungs, thepatient is at high risk for barotrauma (pneumothorax), evidenced byincreased peak pressures, decreased breath sounds on one side, andrestlessness. Monitor nutrition, maintain joint mobility, and prevent skin breakdown.Accurately record calorie intake. Give tube feedings and parenteralnutrition, as ordered. Perform passive range-of-motion exercises or helpthe patient perform active exercises, if possible. Provide meticulous skincare. Plan patient care to allow periods of uninterrupted sleep. Provide emotional support. Wam the family and the patient who srecovering from ARDS that recovery will take some time and that they willfeel weak for a while. Watch for and immediately report all respiratory changes in the patientwith injuries that may adversely affect the lungs (especially during the 2- to3-day period after the injury, when the patient may appear to beimproving).HITE PREVENTION Prevent VAP through use of the Ventilator Bundle andother best practices, such as continuous removal of subglottic secretions,change of ventilator circuit no more often than every 48 hours, andperformance of hand hygiene before and after contact with each patient.ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE IN COPDIn patients with essentially normal lung tissue, ARF usually means Paco,above 50 mm Hg and Pao, below 50 mm Hg. These limits, however, don t",19,105
236,"apply to patients with COPD, who usually have a consistently high Paco, andlow Pao,. In patients with COPD, only acute deterioration in ABG values,with corresponding clinical deterioration, indicates ARF.Causes and Incidence ARF may develop in patients with COPD as a result of any condition thatincreases the work of breathing and decreases the respiratory drive. Suchconditions include respiratory tract infection (such as bronchitis orpneumonia). The most common precipitating factor is bronchospasm, oraccumulating secretions secondary to cough suppression. Other causes of ARFin COPD include the following:CNS depression head trauma or injudicious use of sedatives, opioids,tranquilizers, or oxygen (O,) Cardiovascular disorders myocardial infarction, heart failure, orpulmonary emboli Airway irritants smoke or fumes Endocrine and metabolic disorders myxedema or metabolic alkalosis Thoracic abnormalities chest trauma, pneumothorax, or thoracic orabdominal surgery The incidence of ARF increases markedly with age and is especially highamong people age 65 and older.Pathophysiology An acute and progressive exacerbation of COPD is triggered by the cessationof maintenance medications or some type of infection. Damage to theepithelium from ongoing exposure to noxious gases or particles impairs themucociliary response causing the accumulation of mucus and bacteria andcontributing to the obstruction of airways. The permeant enlargement of theairspaces by the terminal bronchioles leads to a decrease in the alveolarsurface area for gas exchange and contributes to ineffective ventilation.Complications Respiratory failure Pneumonia Hypoxemia Pneumothorax",7,91
237,"Heart failure Signs And Symptoms In patients who have COPD with ARF, increased ventilation perfusionmismatch and reduced alveolar ventilation decrease Pao, (hypoxemia) andincrease Paco, (hypercapnia). This rise in CO, lowers the p H. The resultinghypoxemia and acidemia affect all body organs, especially the CNS and therespiratory and cardiovascular systems.Specific symptoms vary with the underlying cause of ARF but may includethese systems: Respiratory Rate may be increased, decreased, or normal depending onthe cause; respirations may be shallow, deep, or altemate between the two;and air hunger may occur. Cyanosis may or may not be present, dependingon the Hb level and arterial oxygenation. Auscultation of the chest mayreveal crackles, rhonchi, wheezing, or diminished breath sounds. CNS When hypoxemia and hypercapnia occur, the patient may showevidence of restlessness, confusion, loss of concentration, irritability,tremulousness, diminished tendon reflexes, and papilledema; the patientmay slip into a coma. Cardiovascular Tachycardia, with increased cardiac output and mildlyelevated blood pressure secondary to adrenal release of catecholamine,occurs early in response to low Pao,. With myocardial hypoxia,arrhythmias may develop. Pulmonary hypertension, secondary topulmonary capillary vasoconstriction, may cause increased pressures onthe right side of the heart, jugular vein distention, an enlarged liver, andperipheral edema. Stresses on the heart may precipitate cardiac failure.Diagnosis Progressive deterioration in ABG levels and p H, when compared with thepatient s normal values, strongly suggests ARF in COPD. (In patients withessentially normal lung tissue, p H below 7.35 usually indicates ARF, butpatients with COPD display an even greater deviation from this normal value,as they do with Paco, and Pao,.)Other supporting findings include: Bicarbonate Increased levels indicate metabolic alkalosis or reflectmetabolic compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis.",11,114
238,"Hematocrit (HCT) and Hb Abnormally low levels may be due to bloodloss, indicating decreased oxygen-carrying capacity. Elevated levels mayoccur with chronic hypoxemia. Serum electrolytes Hypokalemia and hypochloremia may result fromdiuretic and corticosteroid therapies used to treat ARF. White blood cell count Count is elevated if ARF is due to bacterialinfection; Gram stain and sputum culture can identify pathogens.Chest X-ray Findings identify pulmonary pathologic conditions, such asemphysema, atelectasis, lesions, pneumothorax, infiltrates, or effusions. Electrocardiogram Arrhythmias commonly suggest cor pulmonale andmyocardial hypoxia.Treatment ARF in patients with COPD is an emergency that requires cautious O, therapy(using nasal prongs or Venturi mask) to raise the Pao,. In patients with chronichypercapnia, O, therapy can cause hypoventilation by increasing Paco, anddecreasing the respiratory drive, necessitating mechanical ventilation. Theminimum fraction of inspired air (F1o,) required to maintain ventilation or O,saturation greater than 85 to 90 should be used. If significantuncompensated respiratory acidosis or unrefractory hypoxemia exists,mechanical ventilation (through an ET or a tracheostomy tube) or noninvasiveventilation (with a face or nose mask) may be necessary. Treatment routinelyincludes antibiotics for infection, bronchodilators, and possibly steroids.Special Considerations Because most patients with ARF are treated in an intensive care unit, orientthem to the environment, procedures, and routines to minimize their anxiety. To reverse hypoxemia, administer O, at appropriate concentrations tomaintain Pao, at a minimum of 50 to 60 mm Hg. Patients with COPDusually require only small amounts of supplemental O,. Watch for apositive response such as improvement in the patient s breathing, color,and ABG levels. Maintain a patent airway. If the patient is retaining CO,, encourage them tocough and to breathe deeply. Teach them to use pursed-lip anddiaphragmatic breathing to control dyspnea. If the patient is alert, havethem use an incentive spirometer; if they are intubated and lethargic, tum",16,108
239,"the patient every 1 to 2 hours. Use postural drainage and chestphysiotherapy to help clear secretions. Inan intubated patient, suction the trachea as needed afterhyperoxygenation. Observe for a change in quantity, consistency, and colorof sputum. Provide humidification to liquefy secretions. Observe the patient closely for respiratory arrest. Auscultate for chestsounds. Monitor ABG levels and report any changes immediately. Check the cardiac monitor for arrhythmias.If the patient requires mechanical ventilation: Check ventilator settings, cuff pressures, and ABG values often because the Fio, setting depends on ABG levels. Draw specimens for ABG analysis 20to 30 minutes after every Frio, change or oximetry check. Prevent infection by performing hand hygiene and using sterile techniquewhile suctioning. Stress ulcers are common in the intubated patient. Check gastric secretionsfor evidence of bleeding if the patient has a nasogastric (NG) tube or if thepatient complains of epigastric tendemess, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor Hb level and HCT; check all stools for occult blood. Administer antacids,histamine-2 receptor antagonists, or sucralfate, as ordered. To prevent nasal necrosis, keep the nasotracheal tube midline within thepatient s nostrils and provide good hygiene. Loosen the tape periodicallyto prevent skin breakdown. Avoid excessive movement of any tubes; makesure the ventilator tubing is adequately supported.HITEM PREVENTION To prevent VAP. implement Ventilator Bundle. Prevent tracheal erosion, which can result from artificial airway cuffoverinflation. Use the minimal leak technique and a cuffed tube withhigh residual volume (low-pressure cuff), a foam cuff, or a pressure-regulating valve on the cuff: To prevent oral or vocal cord trauma, make sure that the ET tube ispositioned midline or moved carefully from side to side every 8 hours.PULMONARY EDEMA",21,100
240,"Pulmonary edema is the accumulation of fluid in the extravascular spaces ofthe lung. In cardiogenic pulmonary edema, fluid accumulation results fromelevations in pulmonary venous and capillary hydrostatic pressures. Acommon complication of cardiac disorders, pulmonary edema can occur as achronic condition or it can develop quickly to cause death. (See Howpulmonary edema develops, page 131.)Causes And Incidence Pulmonary edema usually results from left-sided heart failure due toarteriosclerotic, hypertensive, cardiomyopathic, or valvular cardiac disease.In such disorders, the compromised left ventricle is unable to maintainadequate cardiac output; increased pressures are transmitted to the left atrium,pulmonary veins, and pulmonary capillary bed. This increased pulmonarycapillary hydrostatic force promotes transudation of intravascular fluids intothe pulmonary interstitium, decreasing lung compliance and interfering withgas exchange. Other factors that may predispose the patient to pulmonaryedema include: excessive infusion of I.V. fluids decreased serum colloid osmotic pressure as a result of nephrosis, protein-losing enteropathy, extensive bums, hepatic disease, or nutritionaldeficiency impaired lung lymphatic drainage from Hodgkin lymphoma or obliterativelymphangitis after radiation mitral stenosis, which impairs left atrial emptying pulmonary veno-occlusive disease lung damage froma severe infection or exposure to poisonous gas kidney failure Pathophysiology A hemodynamic disturbance or alteration in the permeability of themicrovasculature allowing fluid to pass through into the interstitial space.This interstitial edema progresses when the capacity of the lymphatics isexceeded and unable to drain the fluid efficiently and subsequently decreasinglung compliance and shortness of breath.Complications",8,86
241,"respiratory failure pleural effusion edema to lower extremities and abdomen death Signs and Symptoms The early symptoms of pulmonary edema reflect interstitial fluid accumulationand diminished lung compliance: dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal noctumaldyspnea, orthopnea, and coughing. Clinical features include tachycardia,tachypnea, dependent crackles, jugular vein distention, and a diastolic (S,)gallop. With severe pulmonary edema, the alveoli and bronchioles may fillwith fluid and intensify the early symptoms. Respiration becomes labored andrapid, with more diffuse crackles and coughing that produces frothy, bloodysputum. Tachycardia increases, and arrhythmias may occur. Skin becomescold, clammy, diaphoretic, and cyanotic. Blood pressure falls and the pulsebecomes thready as cardiac output falls.Symptoms of severe heart failure with pulmonary edema may also includesigns of hypoxemia, such as anxiety, restlessness, and changes in the patient slevel of consciousness.Diagnosis Clinical features of pulmonary edema permit a working diagnosis. ABGanalysis usually shows hypoxia; the Paco, is variable. Profound respiratoryalkalosis and acidosis may occur. Chest X-ray shows diffuse haziness of thelung fields and, commonly, cardiomegaly and pleural effusions. Ultrasound(echocardiogram) may show weak heart muscle, leaking or narrow heartvalves, and fluid surrounding the heart. Pulmonary artery catheterization helpsidentify left-sided heart failure by showing elevated PAWPs. This helps torule out ARDS in which pulmonary wedge pressure is usually normal.Treatment Treatment measures for pulmonary edema are designed to reduceextravascular fluid, improve gas exchange and myocardial function and, ifpossible, correct any underlying pathologic conditions.Administration of high concentrations of oxygen by a cannula, a face maskand, if the patient fails to maintain an acceptable Pao, level, assistedventilation improves oxygen delivery to the tissues and usually improves",13,110
242,"acid-base disturbances. Diuretics furosemide and bumetanide, for example promote diuresis, which reduces extravascular fluid.Treatment of heart failure includes angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitors, diuretics, inotropic drugs such as digoxin, antiarrhythmic agents,beta-adrenergic blockers, and human B-type natriuretic peptide. Vasodilatordrugs, such as nitroprusside, may be used to reduce preload and afterload inacute episodes of pulmonary edema.Morphine is used to reduce anxiety and dyspnea as well as dilate thesystemic venous bed, promoting blood flow from pulmonary circulation to theperiphery.Special Considerations Carefully monitor the vulnerable patient for early signs of pulmonaryedema, especially tachypnea, tachycardia, and abnormal breath sounds.Report any abnormalities. Assess for peripheral edema and weight gain,which may also indicate that fluid is accumulating in tissue. Administer oxygen as ordered. Monitor the patient s vital signs every 15 to 30 minutes whileadministering nitroprusside in dextrose 5 in water by IV. drip. Protectthe nitroprusside solution from light by wrapping the bottle or bag withaluminum foil and discard unused solution after 4 hours. Watch forarrhythmias in the patient receiving cardiac glycosides and for markedrespiratory depression in the patient receiving morphine. Assess the patient s condition frequently, and record response to treatment.Monitor ABG levels, oral and I.V. fluid intake, urine output and, in thepatient with a pulmonary artery catheter, pulmonary end-diastolic andwedge pressures. Check the cardiac monitor often. Report changesimmediately. Carefully record the time and amount of morphine given. Reassure the patient, who will be anxious because of hypoxia andrespiratory distress. Explain all procedures. Provide emotional support tothe family as well.COR PULMONALEThe World Health Organization defines chronic cor pulmonale as hypertrophy of the right ventricle resulting from diseases affecting thefunction or the structure of the lungs, except when these pulmonary alterations",17,106
243,"are the result of diseases that primarily affect the left side of the heart or ofcongenital heart disease. Invariably, cor pulmonale follows some disorder ofthe lungs, pulmonary vessels, chest wall, or respiratory control center. Forinstance, COPD produces pulmonary hypertension, which leads to rightventricular hypertrophy and right-sided heart failure. Because cor pulmonalegenerally occurs late during the course of COPD and other irreversiblediseases, the prognosis is generally poor.Causes and Incidence Approximately 85 of patients with cor pulmonale have COPD, and 25 ofpatients with COPD eventually develop cor pulmonale.Other respiratory disorders that produce cor pulmonale include: obstructive lung diseases for example, bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosisrestrictive lung diseases for example, pneumoconiosis, interstitialpneumonitis, scleroderma, and sarcoidosis loss of lung tissue after extensive lung surgery congenital cardiac shunts such as a ventricular septal defect pulmonary vascular diseases for example, recurrent thromboembolism,primary pulmonary hypertension, schistosomiasis, and pulmonaryvasculitis respiratory insufficiency without pulmonary disease for example, in chestwall disorders such as kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular incompetence due tomuscular dystrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polymyositis, andspinal cord lesions above C6 obesity hypoventilation syndrome (pickwickian syndrome) and upperairway obstruction living at high altitudes (chronic mountain sickness)Cor pulmonale accounts for about 25 of all types of heart failure. It smost common in areas of the world where the incidence of cigarette smokingand COPD is high; cor pulmonale affects middle-aged to elderly men moreoften than women, but the incidence in women is increasing. In children, corpulmonale may be a complication of cystic fibrosis, hemosiderosis, upperairway obstruction, scleroderma, extensive bronchiectasis, neurologicdiseases affecting respiratory muscles, or abnormalities of the respiratorycontrol center.Pathophysiology",6,90
244,"Pulmonary capillary destruction and pulmonary vasoconstriction (usuallysecondary to hypoxia) reduce the area of the pulmonary vascular bed. Thus,pulmonary vascular resistance is increased, causing pulmonary hypertension.To compensate for the extra work needed to force blood through the lungs, theright ventricle dilates and hypertrophies. In response to low oxygen content,the bone marrow produces more red blood cells (RBCs), causingerythrocytosis. When the HCT exceeds 55 , blood viscosity increases, whichfurther aggravates pulmonary hypertension and increases the hemodynamicload on the right ventricle. Right-sided heart failure is the result.Complications Right- and left-sided heart failure Hepatomegaly Edema Ascites Pleural effusions Thromboembolism Signs and Symptoms As long as the heart can compensate for the increased pulmonary vascularresistance, clinical features reflect the underlying disorder and occur mostlyin the respiratory system. They include chronic productive cough, exertionaldyspnea, wheezing respirations, fatigue, and weakness. Progression of corpulmonale is associated with dyspnea (even at rest) that worsens on exertion,tachypnea, orthopnea, edema, weakness, and right upper quadrant discomfort.Chest examination reveals findings characteristic of the underlying lungdisease.Signs of cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure include dependentedema; distended jugular veins; prominent parastemal or epigastric cardiacimpulse; hepatojugular reflux; an enlarged, tender liver; ascites; andtachycardia. Decreased cardiac output may cause a weak pulse andhypotension. Chest examination yields various findings, depending on theunderlying cause of cor pulmonale.In COPD, auscultation reveals wheezing, rhonchi, and diminished breathsounds. When the disease is secondary to upper airway obstruction or damageto CNS respiratory centers, chest findings may be normal, except for a rightventricular lift, gallop rhythm, and loud pulmonic component of S,. Tricuspid",11,99
245,"insufficiency produces a pansystolic murmur heard at the lower left stemalborder; its intensity increases on inspiration, distinguishing it from a murmurdue to mitral valve disease. A right ventricular early murmur that increases oninspiration can be heard at the left stemal border or over the epigastrium. Asystolic pulmonic ejection click may also be heard. Alterations in the patient slevel of consciousness may occur.Diagnosis PAP measurements show increased right ventricular and PAPs, stemmingfrom increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Right ventricular systolicand pulmonary artery systolic pressures will exceed 30 mm Hg. Pulmonaryartery diastolic pressure will exceed 15 mm Hg. Echocardiography or angiography indicates right ventricular enlargement;echocardiography can estimate PAP while also ruling out structural andcongenital lesions. Chest X-ray shows large central pulmonary arteries and suggests rightventricular enlargement by rightward enlargement of the heart s silhouetteon an anterior chest film. ABG analysis shows decreased Pao, (typically less than 70 mm Hg andusually no more than 90 mm Hg on room air). Electrocardiogram frequently shows arrhythmias, such as premature atrialand ventricular contractions and atrial fibrillation during severe hypoxia; itmay also show right bundle-branch block, right axis deviation, prominent Pwaves and inverted T wave in right precordial leads, and right ventricularhypertrophy. PFTs show results consistent with the underlying pulmonary disease. HCT is typically greater than 50 .Treatment Treatment of cor pulmonale is designed to reduce hypoxemia, increase thepatient s exercise tolerance and, when possible, correct the underlyingcondition.In addition to bed rest, treatment may include administration of: acardiac glycoside (digoxin) antibiotics when respiratory infection is present; culture and sensitivity ofa sputum specimen helps select an antibiotic",12,85
246,"potent pulmonary artery vasodilators (such as diazoxide, nitroprusside,hydralazine, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channelblockers, or prostaglandins) in primary pulmonary hypertension oxygen by mask or cannula in concentrations ranging from 24 to 40 ,depending on Pao,, as necessary; in acute cases, therapy may also includemechanical ventilation; patients with underlying COPD generally shouldn treceive high concentrations of oxygen because of possible subsequentrespiratory depression a low-sodium diet, restricted fluid intake, and diuretics, such asfurosemide, to reduce edema phlebotomy to reduce the RBC count anticoagulants to reduce the risk of thromboembolism Depending on the underlying cause, some variations in treatment may beindicated. For example, a tracheotomy may be necessary if the patient has anupper airway obstruction. Steroids may be used in the patient with a vasculitisautoimmune phenomenon or acute exacerbations of COPD.Special Considerations Plan diet carefully with the patient and staff dietitian. Because the patientmay lack energy and tire easily when eating, provide small, frequentfeedings rather than three heavy meals. Prevent fluid retention by limiting the patient s fluid intake to 1 to 2 qt (1 to2 L)/day and providing a low-sodium diet. Monitor serum potassium levels closely if the patient is receivingdiuretics. Low serum potassium levels can increase the risk of arrhythmiasassociated with cardiac glycosides. Watch the patient for signs of digoxin toxicity, such as complaints ofanorexia, nausea, vomiting, and halos around visual images and colorperception shifts. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias. Teach the patient tocheck their radial pulse before taking digoxin or any cardiac glycoside.They should be instructed to notify the physician if they detect changes inpulse rate. Reposition bedridden patients often to prevent atelectasis. Provide meticulous respiratory care, including oxygen therapy and, for thepatient with COPD, pursed-lip breathing exercises. Periodically measure ABG levels and watch for signs of respiratory failure: changes in pulse",13,104
247,"rate, labored respirations, changes in mental status, and increased fatigueafter exertion.Before discharge, maintain the following protocol:Make sure that the patient understands the importance of maintaining a low-sodium diet, weighing himself daily, and watching for increased edema.Teach patient to detect edema by pressing the skin over a shin with onefinger, holding it for a second or two, then checking for a fingerimpression. Increased weight, increased edema, or respiratory difficultyshould be reported to the healthcare provider. Instruct the patient to plan for frequent rest periods and to do breathingexercises regularly. If the patient needs supplemental oxygen therapy at home, refer them to anagency that can help obtain the required equipment and, as necessary,arrange for follow-up examinations. If the patient has been placed on anticoagulant therapy, emphasize the needto watch for bleeding (epistaxis, hematuria, bruising) and to report signs tothe physician. Also encourage patient to retum for periodic laboratory teststo monitor partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen level, plateletcount, HCT, Hb level, and prothrombin time.Because pulmonary infection commonly exacerbates COPD and corpulmonale, tell the patient to watch for and immediately report early signsof infection, such as increased sputum production, change in sputum color,increased coughing or wheezing, chest pain, fever, and tightness in thechest. Tell the patient to avoid crowds and persons known to havepulmonary infections, especially during the flu season. The patient shouldreceive pneumovax and annual influenza vaccines.Wam the patient to avoid substances that may depress the ventilatory drive,such as sedatives and alcohol.LEGIONNAIRES DISEASELegionnaires disease is an acute bronchopneumonia produced by a gram-negative bacillus, Legionella pneumophila. It derives its name and notorietyfrom the peculiar, highly publicized disease that struck 182 people (29 ofwhom died) at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia in July 1976.This disease may occur epidemically or sporadically, usually in late summeror early fall. Its severity ranges from a mild illness, with or without",10,106
248,"pneumonitis, to multilobar pneumonia, with a mortality as high as 15 . Amilder, self-limiting form (Pontiac syndrome) subsides within a few days butleaves the patient fatigued for several weeks. This form mimics Legionnaires disease but produces few or no respiratory symptoms, no pneumonia, and nofatalities.Causes and Incidence Legionella pneumophila is an aerobic, gram-negative bacillus that s probablytransmitted by an airbome route. In past epidemics, it has spread throughcooling towers or evaporation condensers in air-conditioning systems.However, Legionella bacilli also flourish in soil and excavation sites. Thedisease doesn t spread from person to person.Legionnaires disease is most likely to affect: middle-aged and elderly people immunocompromised patients (particularly those receiving corticosteroids,e.g., after a transplant) or those with lymphoma or other disordersassociated with delayed hypersensitivity patients with a chronic underlying disease, such as diabetes, chronic renalfailure, or COPD those with alcoholism cigarette smokers those ona ventilator for extended periods Pathophysiology When water droplets containing a sufficient amount of the Legionellabacterium enter the atmosphere they can be inhaled into the lungs. There theyinvade the epithelial cells of the lungs and begin to replicate intracellularlycausing a Legionnaires infection.Complications Respiratory failure Septic shock Acute kidney failure Signs and Symptoms",6,68
249,"The multisystem clinical features of Legionnaires disease follow apredictable sequence, although the onset of the disease may be gradual orsudden. After a 2- to 10-day incubation period, nonspecific, prodromal signsand symptoms appear, including diarrhea, anorexia, malaise, diffuse myalgiasand generalized weakness, headache, and recurrent chills. An unremittingfever develops within 12 to 48 hours with a temperature that may reach 105 F (40.6 C). A cough then develops that s nonproductive initially buteventually may produce grayish, nonpurulent, and occasionally blood-streakedsputum.Other characteristic features include nausea, vomiting, disorientation,mental sluggishness, confusion, mild temporary amnesia, pleuritic chest pain,tachypnea, dyspnea, and fine crackles. Patients who develop pneumonia mayalso experience hypoxia. Other complications include hypotension, delirium,heart failure, arrhythmias, ARF, renal failure, and shock (usually fatal).Diagnosis The patient history focuses on possible sources of infection and predisposingconditions. Additional tests reveal the following: Chest X-ray shows patchy, localized infiltration, which progresses tomultilobar consolidation (usually involving the lower lobes), pleuraleffusion and, in fulminant disease, opacification of the entire lung. Auscultation reveals fine crackles, progressing to coarse crackles as thedisease advances. Abnormal findings include leukocytosis, increased erythrocytesedimentation rate, an increase in liver enzyme levels (alanineaminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase),hyponatremia, decreased Pao, and, initially, decreased Paco,. Bronchialwashings and blood, pleural fluid, and sputum tests rule out otherinfections.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Definitive tests include directimmunofluorescence of respiratory tract secretions and tissue, cultureof L. pneumophila, and indirect fluorescent antibody testing of serumcomparing acute samples with convalescent samples drawn at least 3 weekslater. A convalescent serum showing a fourfold or greater rise in antibodytiter for Legionella confirms the diagnosis.",11,102
250,"Treatment Antibiotic treatment begins as soon as Legionnaires disease is suspected anddiagnostic material is collected; it shouldn t await laboratory confirmation. Aquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin) iscommonly used, although a macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin, orerythromycin) may be prescribed for some patients. Supportive therapyincludes administration of antipyretics, fluid replacement, circulatory supportwith pressor drugs, if necessary, and oxygen administration by mask, cannula,or mechanical ventilation.Special Considerations Closely monitor the patient s respiratory status. Evaluate chest wallexpansion, depth and pattem of respirations, cough, and chest pain. Watchfor restlessness as a sign of hypoxemia, which requires suctioning,repositioning, or more aggressive oxygen therapy. Continually monitor the patient s vital signs, oximetry or ABG values,level of consciousness, and dryness and color of lips and mucousmembranes. Watch for signs of shock (decreased blood pressure, threadypulse, diaphoresis, and clammy skin). Keep the patient comfortable. Provide mouth care frequently. If necessary,apply soothing cream to the nostrils. Replace fluid and electrolytes, as needed. The patient with renal failuremay require dialysis. Provide mechanical ventilation and other respiratory therapy, as needed.Teach the patient how to cough effectively and encourage deep-breathingexercises. Stress the need to continue these until recovery is complete. Give antibiotic therapy as indicated and observe carefully for adverseeffects.ATELECTASISAtelectasis is incomplete expansion of lobules (clusters of alveoli) or lungsegments, which may result in partial or complete lung collapse. Becauseparts of the lung are unavailable for gas exchange, unoxygenated blood passesthrough these areas unchanged, resulting in hypoxemia. Atelectasis may bechronic or acute. Many patients undergoing upper abdominal or thoracicsurgery experience atelectasis to some degree. The prognosis depends on",19,101
251,"prompt removal of any airway obstruction, relief of hypoxemia, and re-expansion of the collapsed lung,Causes Atelectasis commonly results from bronchial occlusion by mucus plugs. It s aproblem in many patients with COPD, bronchiectasis, or cystic fibrosis and inthose who smoke heavily. (Smoking increases mucus production and damagescilia.) Atelectasis may also result from occlusion by foreign bodies,bronchogenic carcinoma, and inflammatory lung disease.Other causes include RDS of the neonate (hyaline membrane disease),oxygen toxicity, and pulmonary edema, in which alveolar surfactant changesincrease surface tension and permit complete alveolar deflation.Extemal compression, which inhibits full lung expansion, or any conditionthat makes deep breathing painful may also cause atelectasis. Suchcompression or pain may result from abdominal surgical incisions, ribfractures, pleuritic chest pain, tight dressings around the chest, stab wounds,impalement accidents, car accidents in which the driver slams into thesteering column, or obesity (which elevates the diaphragm and reduces tidalvolume).Prolonged immobility may also cause atelectasis by producing preferentialventilation of one area of the lung over another. Mechanical ventilation usingconstant small tidal volumes without intermittent deep breaths may also resultin atelectasis. CNS depression (as in drug overdose) eliminates periodicsighing and is a predisposing factor of progressive atelectasis.Pathophysiology Atelectasis results from some type of obstruction or compression of the lungsor bronchus. Retraction of the lung occurs when the blood circulating in thealveolar capillary bed absorbs the gas from the alveolar in the unventilatedlung. The alveolar spaces fill with secretions and cells, preventing thecomplete collapse of the lung. The surrounding tissues distend and displace,shifting the heart and mediastinum toward the ateleactactic area.Complications Respiratory failure Pneumonia Hypoxemia",10,105
252,"Signs and Symptoms Clinical effects vary with the cause of collapse, the degree of hypoxemia, andany underlying disease but generally include some degree of dyspnea.Atelectasis of a small area of the lung may produce only minimal symptomsthat subside without specific treatment. However, massive collapse canproduce severe dyspnea, anxiety, cyanosis, diaphoresis, peripheral circulatorycollapse, tachycardia, and substemal or intercostal retraction. Also,atelectasis may result in compensatory hyperinflation of unaffected areas ofthe lung, mediastinal shift to the affected side, and elevation of the ipsilateralhemidiaphragm.Diagnosis Diagnosis requires an accurate patient history, a physical examination, and achest X-ray. Auscultation reveals diminished or bronchial breath sounds.When much of the lung is collapsed, percussion reveals dullness. However,extensive areas of microatelectasis may exist without abnormalities on thechest X-ray. In widespread atelectasis, the chest X-ray shows characteristichorizontal lines in the lower lung zones. With segmental or lobar collapse,characteristic dense shadows commonly associated with hyperinflation ofneighboring lung zones are also apparent. If the cause is unknown, diagnosticprocedures may include bronchoscopy to rule out an obstructing neoplasm ora foreign body.Treatment Treatment includes incentive spirometry, frequent coughing, and deep-breathing exercises. If atelectasis is secondary to mucus plugging, mucolytics,chest percussion, and postural drainage may be used. If these measures fail,bronchoscopy may be helpful in removing secretions. Humidity andbronchodilators can improve mucociliary clearance and dilate airways.Atelectasis secondary to an obstructing neoplasm may require surgery orradiation therapy. Postoperative thoracic and abdominal surgery patientsrequire analgesics to facilitate deep breathing, which minimizes the risk ofatelectasis.Special Considerations",12,94
253,"If mechanical ventilation is used, tidal volume should be maintained atappropriate levels to ensure adequate expansion of the lungs. Use the sighmechanism on the ventilator, if appropriate, to intermittently increase tidalvolume at the rate of 10 to 15 sighs/hour. Implement the Ventilator Bundleto prevent VAP. Use an incentive spirometer to encourage deep inspiration through positivereinforcement. Teach the patient how to use the spirometer and encouragethem to use it every to 2 hours. Humidify inspired air and encourage adequate fluid intake to mobilizesecretions. To promote loosening and clearance of secretions, encouragedeep-breathing and coughing exercises and use postural drainage and chestpercussion. If the patient is intubated or uncooperative, provide suctioning, as needed.Use sedatives with discretion because they depress respirations and thecough reflex as well as suppress sighing. However, remember that thepatient won t cooperate with treatment if they are in pain. Assess breath sounds and ventilatory status frequently; report changes atonce. Teach the patient about respiratory care, including postural drainage,coughing, and deep breathing. Encourage the patient to stop smoking and lose weight, as needed. Referthem to appropriate support groups for help. Provide reassurance and emotional support; the patient may be anxiousbecause of hypoxia or respiratory distress. PREVENTION t Ina patient who is bedridden, encourage movement and deep breathing. Administer adequate analgesics. To prevent atelectasis, encourage the postoperative or other high-riskpatient to cough and deep-breathe every 1 to 2 hours. To minimize painduring coughing exercises, splint the incision; teach the patient thistechnique as well. Gently reposition the patient often and encourageambulation as soon as possible. Teach patients to keep small objects out of reach of children.RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS",20,85
254,"An acid-base disturbance characterized by reduced alveolar ventilation andmanifested by hypercapnia (Paco, greater than 45 mm Hg), respiratoryacidosis can be acute (because of a sudden failure in ventilation) or chronic(as in long-term pulmonary disease). The prognosis depends on the severity ofthe underlying disturbance as well as the patient s general clinical condition.Causes and Incidence Some predisposing factors in respiratory acidosis include: Drugs Opioids, anesthetics, hypnotics, and sedatives, including some ofthe new designer drugs, such as Ecstasy, decrease the sensitivity of therespiratory center. CNS trauma Medullary injury may impair ventilatory drive. Chronic metabolic alkalosis Respiratory compensatory mechanismsattempt to normalize p H by decreasing alveolar ventilation. Ventilation therapy Use of high-flow oxygen (O,) in chronic respiratorydisorders suppresses the patient s hypoxic drive to breathe. Neuromuscular diseases (such as myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barrésyndrome, and poliomyelitis) Failure of the respiratory muscles torespond properly to respiratory drive decreases alveolar ventilation. In addition, respiratory acidosis can result from airway obstruction orparenchymal lung disease, which interferes with alveolar ventilation;COPD; asthma; severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS);chronic bronchitis; large pneumothorax; extensive pneumonia; andpulmonary edema.Hypoventilation compromises elimination of CO, produced throughmetabolism. The retained CO, then combines with water to form an excess ofcarbonic acid, decreasing the blood p H. As a result, the concentration ofhydrogen ions in body fluids, which directly reflects acidity, increases.Pathophysiology Lung diseases or conditions that cause hypoventilation result in CO, beingproduced at a rapid rate. Lack of adequate ventilation quickly increases thepartial pressure of arterial CO,. The increase in Paco, also results in thedecrease in bicarbonate ration and decreasing the p H to an acidotic state.Complications",10,97
255,"Shock Cardiac arrest Signs and Symptoms Acute respiratory acidosis produces CNS disturbances that reflect changes inthe p H of cerebrospinal fluid rather than increased CO, levels in cerebralcirculation. Effects range from restlessness, confusion, and apprehension tosomnolence, with a fine or flapping tremor (asterixis), or coma. The patientmay complain of headaches as well as exhibiting dyspnea and tachypnea withpapilledema and depressed reflexes. Unless the patient is receiving O,,hypoxemia accompanies respiratory acidosis. This disorder may also causecardiovascular abnormalities, such as tachycardia, hypertension, atrial andventricular arrhythmias and, in severe acidosis, hypotension with vasodilation(bounding pulses and warm periphery).Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS ABG analysis confirms the diagnosis: Paco,exceeds the normal 45 mm Hg; p H is below the normal range of 7.35 to7.45 unless compensation has occurred; and bicarbonate is normal in theacute stage but elevated in the chronic stage.Chest X-ray, CT scan, and PFTs can help determine the cause.Treatment Effective treatment of respiratory acidosis requires correction of theunderlying source of alveolar hypoventilation.Significantly reduced alveolar ventilation may require mechanicalventilation until the underlying condition can be treated. In COPD, thisincludes bronchodilators, O,, corticosteroids, and antibiotics for infectiousconditions; drug therapy for conditions such as myasthenia gravis; removal offoreign bodies from the airway; antibiotics for pneumonia; dialysis orcharcoal to remove toxic drugs; and correction of metabolic alkalosis.Dangerously low blood p H (less than 7.15) can produce profound CNS andcardiovascular deterioration; careful administration of IV. sodiumbicarbonate may be required. In chronic lung disease, elevated CO, maypersist despite optimal treatment.",8,89
256,"Special Considerations Be alert for critical changes in the patient s respiratory, CNS, andcardiovascular functions. Report such changes as well as any variations in ABG values or electrolyte status immediately. Also, maintain adequatehydration. Maintain a patent airway and provide adequate humidification if acidosisrequires mechanical ventilation. Perform tracheal suctioning regularly andvigorous chest physiotherapy if ordered. Continuously monitor ventilatorsettings and respiratory status. To prevent respiratory acidosis, closely monitor patients with COPD andchronic CO, retention for signs of acidosis. Also, administer O, at lowflow rates; closely monitor all patients who receive opioids and sedatives.Instruct patients who have received general anesthesia to tum, cough, andperform deep-breathing exercises frequently to prevent the onset ofrespiratory acidosis.RESPIRATORY ALKALOSISRespiratory alkalosis is an acid-base disturbance characterized by a decreasein the Paco, to less than 35 mm Hg, which is due to alveolar hyperventilation.Uncomplicated respiratory alkalosis leads to a decrease in hydrogen ionconcentration, which results in elevated blood p H. Hypocapnia occurs whenthe elimination of CO, by the lungs exceeds the production of CO, at thecellular level.Causes Causes of respiratory alkalosis fall into two categories: pulmonary severe hypoxemia, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease,pulmonary vascular disease, and acute asthma nonpulmonary anxiety, fever, aspirin toxicity, metabolic acidosis, CNSdisease (inflammation or tumor), sepsis, hepatic failure, and pregnancy Pathophysiology An underlying condition or stimulus that causes hyperventilation, expels anincreased amount of CO,.

257,"anhydrase which, in tum, decreases the available hydrogen ions andincreasing the p H.Complications Cardiac arrhythmias Seizures Signs and Symptoms The cardinal sign of respiratory alkalosis is deep, rapid breathing, possiblyexceeding 40 breaths/minute. This pattem of breathing is similar to Kussmaul s respirations that characterize diabetic acidosis. Suchhyperventilation usually leads to CNS and neuromuscular disturbances, suchas light-headedness or dizziness (because of below-normal CO, levels thatdecrease cerebral blood flow), agitation, circumoral and_ peripheralparesthesias, carpopedal spasms, twitching (possibly progressing to tetany),and muscle weakness. Severe respiratory alkalosis may cause cardiacarrhythmias (that may fail to respond to conventional treatment), seizures, orboth.Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS ABG analysis confirms respiratory alkalosisand rules out respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis: Paco,less than 35 mm Hg; p H elevated in proportion to the fall in Paco, in theacute stage but falling toward normal in the chronic stage; and bicarbonatenormal in the acute stage, but below normal in the chronic stage.Chest X-ray or PFTs may aid in diagnosing possible lung disease.Treatment Treatment is designed to eradicate the underlying condition for example,removal of ingested toxins, treatment of fever or sepsis, providing oxygen foracute hypoxemia, and treatment of CNS disease. When hyperventilation iscaused by severe anxiety, the patient may be instructed to breathe into a paperbag, which increases CO, levels and helps relieve anxiety.Prevention of hyperventilation in patients receiving mechanical ventilationrequires monitoring ABG levels and adjusting tidal volume and minute",5,92
258,"ventilation.Special Considerations Watch for and report any changes in neurologic, neuromuscular, orcardiovascular functions. Remember that twitching and cardiac arrhythmias may be associated withalkalemia and electrolyte imbalances. Monitor ABG and serum electrolytelevels closely, reporting any variations immediately. Explain all diagnostic tests and procedures to reduce anxiety.PNEUMOTHORAXPneumothorax is an accumulation of air or gas between the parietal andvisceral pleurae. The amount of air or gas trapped in the intrapleural spacedetermines the degree of lung collapse. In tension pneumothorax, the air in thepleural space is under higher pressure than air in adjacent lung and vascularstructures. Without prompt treatment, tension or large pneumothorax results infatal pulmonary and circulatory impairment. (See Understanding tensionpneumothorax, page 112.)PATHOPHYSIOLOGYUNDERSTANDING TENSIONPNEUMOTHORAXIn tension pneumothorax, air accumulates intrapleurally and can tescape. Intrapleural pressure rises, collapsing the ipsilateral lung.On inspiration, the mediastinum On expiration, the mediastinal shiftshifts toward the unaffected lung, distorts the vena cava and reducesimpairing ventilation. venous retum.",11,62
259,"INSPIRATION Causes and Incidence Spontaneous pneumothorax usually occurs in otherwise healthy adults 20 to40 years old. It may be caused by air leakage from ruptured congenital blebsadjacent to the visceral pleural surface, near the apex of the lung. Secondaryspontaneous pneumothorax is a complication of underlying lung disease, suchas COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, TB, and whooping cough. Spontaneouspneumothorax may also occur in interstitial lung disease, such as eosinophilicgranuloma or lymphangiomyomatosis.Traumatic pneumothorax may result from insertion of a central venousline, thoracic surgery, or a penetrating chest injury, such as a gunshot or knifewound. It may follow a transbronchial biopsy, or it may also occur duringthoracentesis or a closed pleural biopsy. When traumatic pneumothoraxfollows a penetrating chest injury, it frequently coexists with hemothorax(blood in the pleural space).In tension pneumothorax, positive pleural pressure develops as a result oftraumatic pneumothorax. When air enters the pleural space through a tear inlung tissue and is unable to leave by the same vent, each inspiration traps airin the pleural space, resulting in positive pleural pressure. This in tum causescollapse of the ipsilateral lung and marked impairment of venous retum,which can severely compromise cardiac output and may cause a mediastinal",8,60
260,"shift. Decreased filling of the great veins of the chest results in diminishedcardiac output and lowered blood pressure.Pathophysiology Pneumothorax can be classified as open or closed. In open pneumothorax(usually the result of trauma), air flows between the pleural space and theoutside of the body. In closed pneumothorax, air reaches the pleural spacedirectly from the lung.Complications Fatal pulmonary and circulatory impairment Signs and Symptoms The cardinal features of pneumothorax are sudden, sharp, pleuritic pain(exacerbated by movement of the chest, breathing, and coughing);asymmetrical chest wall movement; and shortness of breath. Additional signsof tension pneumothorax are weak and rapid pulse, pallor, jugular veindistention, and anxiety. Tracheal deviations may be present with mediastinalshift. Tension pneumothorax produces the most severe respiratory symptoms;a spontaneous pneumothorax that releases only a small amount of air into thepleural space may cause no symptoms. In a nontension pneumothorax, theseverity of symptoms is usually related to the size of the pneumothorax and thedegree of preexisting respiratory disease.Diagnosis Sudden, sharp chest pain and shortness of breath suggest pneumothorax.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Chest X-ray showing air in the pleural spaceand, possibly, mediastinal shift confirms this diagnosis.In the absence of a definitive chest X-ray, the physical examination mayreveal: on inspection overexpansion and rigidity of the affected chest side; intension pneumothorax, jugular vein distention with hypotension andtachycardia",8,82
261,"on palpation crackling beneath the skin, indicating subcutaneousemphysema (air in tissue) and decreased vocal fremitus on percussion hyperresonance on the affected side on auscultation decreased or absent breath sounds over the collapsedlung If the pneumothorax is significant, ABG findings include p H less than 7.35,Pao, less than 80 mm Hg, and Paco, above 45 mm Hg.Treatment Treatment is conservative for spontaneous pneumothorax in which no signs ofincreased pleural pressure (indicating tension pneumothorax) appear, lungcollapse is less than 30 , and the patient shows no signs of dyspnea or otherindications of physiologic compromise. Such treatment consists of bed rest,careful monitoring of blood pressure and pulse and respiratory rates, oxygenadministration and, possibly, needle aspiration of air with a large-bore needleattached to a syringe. If more than 30 of the lung is collapsed, treatment tore-expand the lung includes placing a thoracostomy tube in the second or thirdintercostal space in the midclavicular line (or in the fifth or sixth intercostalspace in the midaxillary line), connected to an underwater seal or low suctionpressures.Recurring spontaneous pneumothorax requires thoracotomy andpleurectomy; these procedures prevent recurrence by causing the lung toadhere to the parietal pleura. Traumatic and tension pneumothoraces requirechest tube drainage; traumatic pneumothorax may also require surgery.Special Considerations VW ALERT Watch for pallor, gasping respirations, and sudden chest pain.Monitor patients vital signs at least every hour for signs of shock,increasing respiratory distress, or mediastinal shift. Listen for breathsounds over both lungs. Falling blood pressure and rising pulse andrespiratory rates may indicate tension pneumothorax, which can be fatalwithout prompt treatment. Urge the patient to control coughing and gasping during thoracotomy.However, after the chest tube is in place, encourage them to cough andbreathe deeply (at least once an hour) to facilitate lung expansion.",7,87
262,"If the patient is undergoing chest tube drainage, watch for continuing airleakage (bubbling), indicating the lung defect has failed to close; this mayrequire surgery. Also watch for increasing subcutaneous emphysema bychecking around the neck or at the tube insertion site for crackling beneaththe skin. If the patient is on a ventilator, watch for difficulty in breathing intime with the ventilator as well as pressure changes on ventilator gauges. Change dressings around the chest tube insertion site according to yourfacility s policy. Don t reposition or dislodge the tube. If it dislodges,immediately place a petroleum gauze dressing over the opening to preventrapid lung collapse. Secure the chest tube drainage apparatus appropriately. Tape connectionssecurely. Monitor the patient s vital signs frequently after thoracotomy. Also, for thefirst 24 hours, assess respiratory status by checking breath sounds hourly.Observe the chest tube site for leakage, noting the amount and color ofdrainage. Help the patient walk, as ordered (usually on the firstpostoperative day), to facilitate deep inspiration and lung expansion. To reassure the patient, explain what pneumothorax is, what causes it, andall diagnostic tests and procedures. Make them as comfortable as possible.(The patient with pneumothorax is usually most comfortable sittingupright.)PNEUMONIAPneumonia is an acute infection of the lung parenchyma that commonly impairsgas exchange.

268,"thoracic surgery, atelectasis, common colds or other viral respiratoryinfections, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic respiratorydisease (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis), influenza,smoking, malnutrition, alcoholism, sickle cell disease, tracheostomy, exposureto noxious gases, aspiration, and immunosuppressive therapy.Predisposing factors for aspiration pneumonia include old age, debilitation,artificial airway use, NG tube feedings, impaired gag reflex, poor oralhygiene, and decreased level of consciousness.In elderly patients and patients who are debilitated, bacterial pneumoniamay follow influenza or a common cold. Respiratory viruses are the mostcommon cause of pneumonia in children 2 to 3 years old. In school-agechildren, mycoplasma pneumonia is more common.Pathophysiology A pathogen or extrinsic agent enters the respiratory tract and invades orinsults the alveoli. When the host defenses are overwhelmed by the inoculumsize or virulence of the pathogen, it results in an infection of the lungparenchyma.Complications Septic shock Hypoxemia Respiratory failure Empyema Lung abscess Bacteremia Endocarditis Pericarditis Meningitis Signs and Symptoms The main symptoms of pneumonia are coughing, sputum production, pleuriticchest pain, shaking chills, shortness of breath, rapid shallow breathing, andfever. Physical signs vary widely, ranging from diffuse, fine crackles to signsof localized or extensive consolidation and pleural effusion. There may alsobe associated symptoms of headache, sweating, loss of appetite, excessfatigue, and confusion (in older people).",6,91
269,"Complications include hypoxemia, respiratory failure, pleural effusion,empyema, lung abscess, and bacteremia, with spread of infection to otherparts of the body, resulting in meningitis, endocarditis, and pericarditis.Diagnosis Clinical features, chest X-ray showing infiltrates, and sputum smeardemonstrating acute inflammatory cells support the diagnosis. Gram stain andsputum culture may identify the organism. Positive blood cultures in thepatient with pulmonary infiltrates strongly suggest pneumonia produced by theorganisms isolated from the blood cultures. Pleural effusions, if present,should be tapped and fluid analyzed for evidence of infection in the pleuralspace. Occasionally, a transtracheal aspirate of tracheobronchial secretions orbronchoscopy with brushings or washings may be done to obtain material forsmear and culture. The patient s response to antimicrobial therapy alsoprovides important evidence of the presence of pneumonia.Treatment Antimicrobial therapy varies with the causative agent. Therapy should bereevaluated early in the course of treatment. Supportive measures includehumidified oxygen therapy for hypoxemia, mechanical ventilation forrespiratory failure, a high-calorie diet and adequate fluid intake, bed rest, andan analgesic to relieve pleuritic chest pain. Patients with severe pneumonia onmechanical ventilation may require PEEP to facilitate adequate oxygenation.Special Considerations Correct supportive care can increase patient comfort, avoid complications,and speed recovery.The following protocol should be observed throughout the illness: Maintain a patent airway and adequate oxygenation. Monitor pulseoximetry. Measure ABG levels, especially in hypoxemic patients.Administer supplemental oxygen if the Pao, is less than 55 to 60 mm Hg.Patients with underlying chronic lung disease should be given oxygencautiously. Teach the patient how to cough and perform deep-breathing exercises toclear secretions; encourage them to do so often. In severe pneumonia thatrequires ET intubation or tracheostomy (with or without mechanical",13,108
270,"ventilation), provide thorough respiratory care. Suction often, using steriletechnique, to remove secretions. Obtain sputum specimens as needed, by suction if the patient can t producespecimens independently. Collect specimens in a sterile container anddeliver them promptly to the microbiology laboratory.Administer antibiotics as ordered, sedation, and pain medication asneeded; record the patient s response to medications. Fever anddehydration may require I.V. fluids and electrolyte replacement. Maintain adequate nutrition to offset hypermetabolic state secondary toinfection. Ask the dietary department to provide a high-calorie, high-protein diet consisting of soft, easy-to-eat foods. Encourage the patient toeat. As necessary, supplement oral feedings with NG tube feedings orparenteral nutrition. Monitor fluid intake and output. Consider limiting theuse of milk products because they may increase sputum production. Provide a quiet, calm environment for the patient, with frequent restperiods. Give emotional support by explaining all procedures (especially intubationand suctioning) to the patient and family. Encourage family visits. Providediversionary activities appropriate to the patient s age. To control the spread of infection, dispose of secretions properly. Tell thepatient to sneeze and cough into a disposable tissue; tape a lined bag to theside of the bed for used tissues.Pneumonia can be prevented as follows: Advise the patient to avoid using antibiotics indiscriminately during minorviral infections because this may result in upper airway colonization withantibiotic-resistant bacteria. If the patient then develops pneumonia, theorganisms producing the pneumonia may require treatment with more toxicantibiotics. Encourage pneumococcal vaccine (pneumovax) and annual influenzavaccination for high-risk patients, such as those with COPD, chronic heartdisease, or sickle cell disease. Urge all bedridden and postoperative patients to perform deep-breathingand coughing exercises frequently. Reposition such patients often topromote full aeration and drainage of secretions. Encourage earlyambulation in postoperative patients. To prevent aspiration during NG tube feedings, elevate the patient s head,check the tube s position, and administer the formula slowly. Don t give",25,117
271,"large volumes at one time; this could cause vomiting. Keep the patient shead elevated for at least 30 minutes after the feeding. Check for residualformula at 4- to 6-hour intervals.HEEEEEEM PREVENTION Perform hand hygiene frequently to prevent infections. Advise patients to avoid taking antibiotics indiscriminately during viralinfections.IDIOPATHIC BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS WITH ORGANIZINGPNEUMONIAIdiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP), alsoknown as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, is one of several types ofbronchiolitis obliterans. Organizing pneumonia refers to unresolvedpneumonia, in which inflammatory alveolar exudate persists and eventuallyundergoes fibrosis. Bronchiolitis obliterans is a generic term used todescribe an inflammatory disease of the small airways.Causes and Incidence BOOP has no known cause. However, other forms of bronchiolitis obliteransand organizing pneumonia may be associated with specific diseases orsituations, such as bone marrow, heart, or heart-lung transplantation; collagenvascular diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupuserythematosus (LE); inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn disease, ulcerativecolitis, and polyarteritis nodosa; bacterial, viral, or mycoplasmal respiratoryinfections; inhalation of toxic gases; and drug therapy with amiodarone,bleomycin, penicillamine, or lomustine.Much debate still exists about the various pathologies and classifications ofbronchiolitis obliterans. Most patients with BOOP are between 50 and 60years old. Incidence is equally divided between men and women. A smokinghistory doesn t seem to increase the risk of developing BOOP.Pathophysiology BOOP is the result of an epithelial injury in the lung that progresses to theformation of fibrinoid inflammatory cell clusters and subsequently intra-",10,78
272,"alveolar fibrosis. Upon biopsy the key characteristic is fibroblastic plugspresent in the alveoli, alveolar ducts, and bronchioles.Complications Respiratory failure Interstitial lung disease Death Signs and Symptoms The presenting symptoms of BOOP are usually subacute, with a flulikesyndrome of fever, persistent and nonproductive cough, dyspnea (especiallywith exertion), malaise, anorexia, and weight loss lasting for several weeks toseveral months. Physical assessment findings may reveal dry crackles as theonly abnormality. Less common symptoms include a productive cough,hemoptysis, chest pain, generalized aching, and night sweats.Diagnosis Diagnosis begins with a thorough patient history meant to exclude any knowncause of bronchiolitis obliterans or diseases with a pathophysiology thatincludes an organizing pneumonia pattem. Chest X-ray usually shows patchy, diffuse airspace opacities with aground-glass appearance that may migrate from one location to another.High-resolution CT scans show areas of consolidation. Except for themigrating opacities, these findings are nonspecific and present in manyother respiratory disorders. PFTs may be normal or show reduced capacities. The diffusing capacityfor carbon monoxide is generally low. ABG analysis usually shows mild to moderate hypoxemia at rest, whichworsens with exercise. Blood tests reveal an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anincreased C-reactive protein level, and an increased WBC count with asomewhat increased proportion of neutrophils and a minor rise ineosinophils. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and Ig M levels are normal or slightlyincreased, and the Ig E level is normal. Bronchoscopy reveals normal or slightly inflamed airways.Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained during bronchoscopy shows a",12,99
273,"moderate elevation in lymphocytes and, sometimes, elevated neutrophiland eosinophil levels. Foamy-looking alveolar macrophages may also befound.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Lung biopsy, thoracoscopy, or bronchoscopy isrequired to confirm the diagnosis of BOOP. Pathologic changes in lungtissue include plugs of connective tissue in the lumen of the bronchioles,alveolar ducts, and alveolar spaces.These changes may occur in other types of bronchiolitis and in otherdiseases that cause organizing pneumonia. They also differentiate BOOP fromconstrictive bronchiolitis (characterized by inflammation and fibrosis thatsurrounds and may narrow or completely obliterate the bronchiolar airways).Although the pathologic findings in proliferative and constrictive bronchiolitisare different, the causes and presentations may overlap. Any known cause ofbronchiolitis obliterans or organizing pneumonia must be ruled out before thediagnosis of BOOP is made.Treatment Corticosteroids are the current treatment for BOOP, although the ideal dosageand duration of treatment remain topics of discussion. Relapse is commonwhen steroids are tapered off or stopped. This usually can be reversed whensteroids are increased or resumed. Occasionally, a patient may need tocontinue corticosteroids indefinitely.Immunosuppressive-cytotoxic drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, have beenused in the few cases of intolerance or unresponsiveness.Oxygen is used to correct hypoxemia. The patient may need either nooxygen or a small amount of oxygen at rest and a greater amount when theyexercise.Other treatments vary, depending on the patient s symptoms, and mayinclude inhaled bronchodilators, cough suppressants, and bronchial hygienetherapies.BOOP is very responsive to treatment and usually can be completelyreversed with corticosteroid therapy. However, a few deaths have beenreported, particularly in patients who had more widespread pathologicchanges in the lung or patients who developed opportunistic infections orother complications related to steroid therapy.",10,92
274,"Special Considerations Explain all diagnostic tests. The patient may experience anxiety andfrustration because of the length of time and number of tests needed toestablish the diagnosis. Explain the diagnosis to the patient and family. This uncommon diagnosismay cause confusion and anxiety. Monitor the patient for adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy: weightgain, moon face, glucose intolerance, fluid and electrolyte imbalance,mood swings, cataracts, peptic ulcer disease, opportunistic infections, andosteoporosis leading to bone fractures. In many cases, these effects leavethe patient unable to tolerate the treatment. Teach the patient and theirfamily about these adverse effects, emphasizing which reactions should bereported to the physician. Teach measures that may help prevent complications related to treatment,such as infection control and improved nutrition. Teach breathing, relaxation, and energy conservation techniques to help thepatient manage symptoms. Monitor oxygenation, both at rest and with exertion. The physician willprobably prescribe an oxygen flow rate for use when the patient is at restand a higher one for exertion. Teach the patient how to increase the oxygenflow rate to the appropriate level for exercise. If the patient needs oxygen at home, ensure continuity of care by makingappropriate referrals to discharge planners, respiratory care practitioners,and home equipment vendors.PULMONARY EMBOLISMThe most common pulmonary complication in hospitalized patients,pulmonary embolism is an obstruction of the pulmonary arterial bed by adislodged thrombus, heart valve vegetation, or foreign substance. Althoughpulmonary infarction that results from embolism may be so mild as to beasymptomatic, massive embolism (more than 50 obstruction of pulmonaryarterial circulation) and the accompanying infarction can be rapidly fatal. (See Looking at pulmonary emboli, page 120.)Looking at Pulmonary Emboli",16,98
275,"This illustration shows multiple emboli in pulmonary artery branches anda larger embolus that has resulted in an infarcted area in the lung.Multipleemboli insmallbranches of left Embolus Net 6 . Ba pulmonary inbranch of ey 2 BA N y 3 siteright pulmonary f xartery Infarctedarea Causes and Incidence Pulmonary embolism generally results from dislodged thrombi originating inthe leg veins. More than half of such thrombi arise in the deep veins of thelegs. Other less common sources of thrombi are the pelvic veins, renal veins,hepatic vein, right side of the heart, and upper extremities. Such thrombusformation results directly from vascular wall damage, venostasis, orhypercoagulability of the blood. Trauma, clot dissolution, sudden musclespasm, intravascular pressure changes, or a change in peripheral blood flowcan cause the thrombus to loosen or fragment. Then the thrombus now calledan embolus floats to the heart s right side and enters the lung through thepulmonary artery. There, the embolus may dissolve, continue to fragment, orgrow.By occluding the pulmonary artery, the embolus prevents alveoli fromproducing enough surfactant to maintain alveolar integrity. As a result, alveolicollapse and atelectasis develops. If the embolus enlarges, it may clog most orall of the pulmonary vessels and cause death.Rarely, the emboli contain air, fat, bacteria, amniotic fluid, tale (from drugsintended for oral administration, which are injected intravenously by addicts),",10,78
276,"or tumor cells.Predisposing factors for pulmonary embolism include long-termimmobility, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure or atrial fibrillation,thrombophlebitis, polycythemia vera, thrombocytosis, autoimmune hemolyticanemia, sickle cell disease, varicose veins, recent surgery, advanced age,pregnancy, lower extremity fractures or surgery, bums, obesity, vascularinjury, cancer, I.V. drug abuse, or hormonal contraceptives.Pathophysiology Once a thrombus dislodges, it travels through to the venous system, through theright side of the heart, and lodges in the pulmonary arteries. The thrombus cancompletely occlude the vessels or only partially block the flow of blood.Many physiologic factors participate in the potential outcomes including theability of the body s thrombolytic system to break down clots, function of theright ventricle, over all condition of lungs, and number and size of emboli.Complications Pulmonary infarction Death Signs and Symptoms Total occlusion of the main pulmonary artery is rapidly fatal; smaller orfragmented emboli produce symptoms that vary with the size, number, andlocation of the emboli. Usually, the first symptom of pulmonary embolism isdyspnea, which may be accompanied by anginal or pleuritic chest pain. Otherclinical features include tachycardia, productive cough (sputum may be blood-tinged), low-grade fever, and pleural effusion. Less common signs includemassive hemoptysis, chest splinting, leg edema and, with a large embolus,cyanosis, syncope, and distended jugular veins.In addition, pulmonary embolism may cause pleural friction rub and signsof circulatory collapse (weak, rapid pulse, and hypotension) and hypoxia(restlessness and anxiety).Diagnosis The patient history should reveal predisposing conditions for pulmonaryembolism. A triad of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) formation is stasis,endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability. Risk factors include long car or",8,103
277,"plane trips, cancer, pregnancy, hypercoagulability, prior DVT, and pulmonaryemboli. Chest X-ray helps to rule out other pulmonary diseases; areas ofatelectasis, an elevated diaphragm and pleural effusion, a prominentpulmonary artery and, occasionally, the characteristic wedge-shapedinfiltrate suggestive of pulmonary infarction, or focal oligemia of bloodvessels, are apparent. Lung scan shows perfusion defects in areas beyond occluded vessels;however, it doesn t rule out microemboli. Pulmonary angiography is the most definitive test but requires a skilledangiographer and radiologic equipment; it also poses some risk to thepatient. Its use depends on the uncertainty of the diagnosis and the need toavoid unnecessary anticoagulant therapy in a high-risk patient. Electrocardiography may show right axis deviation; right bundle-branchblock; tall, peaked P waves; ST-segment depression and T-waveinversions (indicative of right-sided heart strain); and supraventriculartachyarrhythmias in extensive pulmonary embolism. A pattem sometimesobserved is S,, Q,, and T, (S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead IIL, andinverted T wave in lead III). Auscultation occasionally reveals a right ventricular S, gallop andincreased intensity of the pulmonic component of S,. Also, crackles and apleural rub may be heard at the embolism site. ABG analysis showing a decreased Pao, and Paco, are characteristic butdon t always occur.If pleural effusion is present, thoracentesis may rule out empyema, whichindicates pneumonia.Treatment Treatment is designed to maintain adequate cardiovascular and pulmonaryfunction during resolution of the obstruction and to prevent recurrence ofembolic episodes. Because most emboli resolve within 10 to 14 days,treatment consists of oxygen therapy as needed and anticoagulation withheparin to inhibit new thrombus formation, followed by oral warfarin.Heparin therapy is monitored by daily coagulation studies (PTT).Patients with massive pulmonary embolism and shock may need fibrinolytictherapy with thrombolytic therapy (streptokinase, urokinase, or tissue",11,99
278,"plasminogen activator) to enhance fibrinolysis of the pulmonary emboli andremaining thrombi. Emboli that cause hypotension may require the use ofvasopressors. Treatment of septic emboli requires antibiotics notanticoagulants and evaluation for the infection s source, particularlyendocarditis.Surgery is performed on patients who can t take anticoagulants, who haverecurrent emboli during anticoagulant therapy, or who have been treated withthrombolytic agents or pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. This procedure(which shouldn t be performed without angiographic evidence of pulmonaryembolism) consists of vena cava ligation, plication, or insertion of an inferiorvena cava device to filter blood retuming to the heart and lungs.Special Considerations Give oxygen by nasal cannula or mask. Check ABG levels if the patientdevelops fresh emboli or worsening dyspnea. Be prepared to provide ETintubation with assisted ventilation if breathing is severely compromised.Administer heparin, as ordered, through IV. push or continuous drip.Monitor coagulation studies daily. Effective heparin therapy raises the PTTto more than 1 times normal. Watch closely for nosebleeds, petechiae,and other signs of abnormal bleeding; check stools for occult blood.Patients should be protected from trauma and injury; avoid I.M. injectionsand maintain pressure over venipuncture sites for 5 minutes, or untilbleeding stops, to reduce hematoma. After the patient is stable, encourage them to move about often, and assistwith isometric and range-of-motion exercises. Check pedal pulses,temperature, and color of feet to detect venostasis. Never massage thepatient s legs. Offer diversional activities to promote rest and relieverestlessness. Help the patient walk as soon as possible after surgery to preventvenostasis. Maintain adequate nutrition and fluid balance to promote healing. Report frequent pleuritic chest pain, so that analgesics can be prescribed.Also, incentive spirometry can assist in deep breathing. Provide tissuesand a bag for easy disposal of expectorations. Wam the patient not to cross their legs; this promotes thrombus formation. To relieve anxiety, explain procedures and treatments. Encourage thepatient s family to participate in their care.",21,119
279,"Most patients need treatment with an oral anticoagulant (warfarin) for 3 to6 months after a pulmonary embolism. Advise these patients to watch forsigns of bleeding (bloody stools, blood in urine, and large ecchymoses), totake the prescribed medication exactly as ordered, not to change dosageswithout consulting their physician, and to avoid taking additionalmedication (including aspirin and vitamins). Stress the importance offollow-up laboratory tests (intemational normalized ratio) to monitoranticoagulant therapy.HITE PREVENTION Encourage early ambulation in patients predisposed to this condition.With close medical supervision, low-dose heparin may be usefulprophylactically. In high-risk patients, low molecular-weight heparin may be given.SARCOIDOSISSarcoidosis is a multisystem, granulomatous disorder that characteristicallyproduces lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltration, and skeletal, liver, eye, orskin lesions. Acute sarcoidosis usually resolves within 2 years. Chronic,progressive sarcoidosis, which is uncommon, is associated with pulmonaryfibrosis and progressive pulmonary disability.Causes and Incidence The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but these factors may play a role: hypersensitivity response (possibly from T-cell imbalance) to such agentsas atypical mycobacteria, fungi, and pine pollen genetic predisposition (suggested by a slightly higher incidence ofsarcoidosis within the same family) extreme immune response to infection Sarcoidosis occurs most commonly in adults 30 to 50 years old. In the United States, sarcoidosis occurs predominantly among blacks, affectingtwice as many women as men.Pathophysiology",7,83
280,"In the development of sarcoidosis, T cells play an important role by initiatinga significant immune reaction. In sites where there is disease activity, aconcentration of CD4 cells exist along with a release of interleukin-2. Thisresults in a disequilibrium of the CD4/CD8 ratio. The exaggerated immuneresponse creates the characteristic noncaseating granulomas, found primarilyon the lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes.Complications Pulmonary fibrosis Pulmonary hypertension Cor pulmonale Signs and Symptoms Initial symptoms of sarcoidosis include arthralgia (in the wrists, ankles, andelbows), fatigue, malaise, and weight loss. Other clinical features varyaccording to the extent and location of the fibrosis: Respiratory breathlessness, cough (usually nonproductive), substemalpain; complications in advanced pulmonary disease include pulmonaryhypertension and cor pulmonale Cutaneous erythema nodosum, subcutaneous skin nodules withmaculopapular eruptions, and extensive nasal mucosal lesions Ophthalmic anterior uveitis (common), glaucoma, and blindness (rare) Lymphatic bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy andsplenomegaly Musculoskeletal muscle weakness, polyarthralgia, pain, and punched-outlesions on phalanges Hepatic granulomatous hepatitis, usually asymptomatic Genitourinary hypercalciuria Cardiovascular arrhythmias (premature beats, bundle-branch or completeheart block) and, rarely, cardiomyopathy CNS cranial or peripheral nerve palsies, basilar meningitis, seizures,and pituitary and hypothalamic lesions producing diabetes insipidus Diagnosis Typical clinical features with appropriate laboratory data and X-ray findingssuggest sarcoidosis. A positive skin lesion biopsy supports the diagnosis.",6,87

However, thoseseverely affected with sarcoidosis require treatment with corticosteroids.Such therapy is usually continued for 1 to 2 years, but some patients may needlifelong therapy. Immunosuppressive agents, such as _ methotrexate,azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide, may also be used. If organ failure occurs(although this is rare), transplantation may be required. Other measuresinclude a low-calcium diet and avoidance of direct exposure to sunlight inpatients with hypercalcemia.Special Considerations Watch for and report any complications. Be aware of abnormal laboratoryresults (e.g., anemia) that could alter patient care. For the patient with arthralgia, administer analgesics as ordered. Recordsigns of progressive muscle weakness. Provide a nutritious, high-calorie diet and plenty of fluids. If the patient hashypercalcemia, suggest a low-calcium diet. Weigh the patient regularly todetect weight loss. Monitor respiratory function. Check chest X-rays for the extent of lunginvolvement; note and record any bloody sputum or increase in sputum.

The disease was first recognized in 2003 with outbreaks in China, Canada, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam, with other countries including the United States reporting smaller numbers of cases.Causes and Incidence SARS is caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-Co V).Coronaviruses are a common cause of mild respiratory illnesses in humans,but researchers believe that a virus may have mutated, allowing it to causethis potentially life-threatening disease.Close contact with a person who s infected with SARS, including contactwith infectious aerosolized droplets or body secretions, is the method oftransmission. Most people who contracted the disease during the 2003outbreak contracted it during travel to endemic areas. However, the virus hasbeen found to live on hands, tissues, and other surfaces for up to 6 hours in itsdroplet form. It has also been found to live in the stool of people with SARSfor up to 4 days. The virus may be able to live for months or years in below-freezing temperatures.Pathophysiology",11,103
283,"SARS-Co V is replicated primarily in the lungs but is also found to have thesame ability in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Once an infection has beenestablished, the virus will cause lysis of cells in the lungs and GI tissues andinitiating an immune response. Most tissue damage takes place in thepulmonary tissues and alveoli.Complications Respiratory failure Liver failure Heart failure Myelodysplastic syndromes Death Signs and Symptoms The incubation period for SARS is typically 3 to 5 days but may last as longas 14 days. Initial signs and symptoms include fever, shortness of breath andother minor respiratory symptoms, general discomfort, headache, rigors,chills, myalgia, sore throat, and dry cough. Some individuals may developdiarrhea or a rash. Later complications include respiratory failure, liverfailure, heart failure, myelodysplastic syndromes, and death.Diagnosis Diagnosis of severe respiratory illness is made when the patient has a fevergreater than 100.4 F (38 C) or upon clinical findings of lower respiratoryillness and a chest X-ray demonstrating pneumonia or ARDS.

Other treatment measures include supplementaloxygen, chest physiotherapy, or mechanical ventilation. In addition to standardprecautions, contact precautions requiring gowns and gloves for all patientcontacts and airbome precautions utilizing a negative-pressure isolation roomand properly fitted N95 respirators are recommended for patients who arehospitalized. Quarantine may be used to prevent the spread of infection.Antibiotics may be given to treat bacterial causes of atypical pneumonia.Antiviral medications have also been used.

288,"LUNG ABSCESSLung abscess is a lung infection accompanied by pus accumulation and tissuedestruction. The abscess may be putrid (due to anaerobic bacteria) omonputrid (due to anaerobes or aerobes) and usually has a well-definedborder. The availability of effective antibiotics has made lung abscess muchless common than it was in the past.Causes and Incidence Lung abscess is a manifestation of necrotizing pneumonia, generally the resultof aspiration of oropharyngeal contents. Poor oral hygiene with dental orgingival (gum) disease is strongly associated with putrid lung abscess. Septicpulmonary emboli commonly produce cavitary lesions. Infected cystic lunglesions and cavitating bronchial carcinoma must be distinguished from lungabscesses.Pathophysiology The development of a lung abscess is a response to the introduction of apathogen, likely from the mouth, into the lower airways. These anaerobes arenot cleared away with the body s initial immune response and create a thick-walled cavity filled with purulent material in response to the infection. Theycan lead to tissue necrosis or possibly the destruction of the involved lungparenchyma.Complications Rupture into pleural space, resulting in empyema Massive hemorrhage Signs and Symptoms The clinical effects of lung abscess include a cough that may produce bloody,purulent, or foul-smelling sputum, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, excessivesweating, chills, fever, headache, malaise, diaphoresis, and weight loss.Chronic lung abscess may cause localized bronchiectasis. Failure of anabscess to improve with antibiotic treatment suggests possible underlyingneoplasm or other causes of obstruction.Diagnosis",9,86
289,"Auscultation of the chest may reveal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Chest X-ray shows a localized infiltrate with one or more clear spaces,usually containing air fluid levels. Percutaneous aspiration or bronchoscopy may be used to obtain cultures toidentify the causative organism. Bronchoscopy is only used if abscessresolution is eventful and the patient s condition permits it. Blood cultures, Gram stain, and sputum culture are also used to detect thecausative organism; leukocytosis (WBC count greater than 10,000/u L) iscommonly present.Treatment Treatment consists of prolonged antibiotic therapy, commonly lasting formonths, until radiographic resolution or definite stability occurs. Symptomsusually disappear in a few weeks. Postural drainage may facilitate dischargeof necrotic material into the upper airways where expectoration is possible;oxygen therapy may relieve hypoxemia. Poor response to therapy requiresresection of the lesion or removal of the diseased section of the lung. Allpatients need rigorous follow-up and serial chest X-rays.Special Considerations Help the patient with chest physiotherapy (including coughing and deepbreathing), increase fluid intake to loosen secretions, and provide a quiet,restful atmosphere. To prevent lung abscess in the unconscious patient and the patient withseizures, first prevent aspiration of secretions. Do this by suctioning thepatient and by positioning in such a way to promote drainage of secretions.HEMOTHORAXIn hemothorax, blood from damaged intercostal, pleural, mediastinal, and(infrequently) lung parenchymal vessels enters the pleural cavity. Dependingon the amount of bleeding and the underlying cause, hemothorax may beassociated with varying degrees of lung collapse and mediastinal shift.Pneumothorax air in the pleural cavity commonly accompanieshemothorax.Causes and Incidence",12,93
290,"Hemothorax usually results from blunt or penetrating chest trauma; in fact,about 25 of patients with such trauma have hemothorax. In some cases, itresults from thoracic surgery, pulmonary infarction, neoplasm, dissectingthoracic aneurysm, or as a complication of TB or anticoagulant therapy.Pathophysiology A hemothorax occurs when a disruption of the chest wall tissues orintrathoracic structures allows blood to enter the pleural space. Depending onthe speed and volume of the circulating blood, there can be a significanthemodynamic shift including the early stages of shock.Complications Mediastinal shift Ventilatory compromise Lung collapse Cardiopulmonary arrest Signs and Symptoms The patient with hemothorax may experience chest pain, tachypnea, and mildto severe dyspnea, depending on the amount of blood in the pleural cavity andassociated pathologic conditions. If respiratory failure results, the patient mayappear anxious, restless, possibly stuporous, and cyanotic; marked blood lossproduces hypotension and shock. The affected side of the chest expands andstiffens, whereas the unaffected side rises and falls with the patient s breaths.Diagnosis Characteristic clinical signs and a history of trauma strongly suggesthemothorax. Percussion and auscultation reveal dullness and decreased toabsent breath sounds over the affected side. Thoracentesis yields blood orserosanguineous fluid; chest X-rays show pleural fluid with or withoutmediastinal shift. ABG analysis may reveal respiratory failure; Hb may bedecreased, depending on the amount of blood lost.Treatment Treatment is designed to stabilize the patient s condition, stop the bleeding,evacuate blood from the pleural space, and re-expand the underlying lung.",8,97
291,"Mild hemothorax usually clears in 10 to 14 days, requiring only observationfor further bleeding. In severe hemothorax, thoracentesis not only serves as adiagnostic tool, but also removes fluid from the pleural cavity.After the diagnosis is confirmed, a chest tube is inserted into the sixthintercostal space at the posterior axillary line. Suction may be used; a large-bore tube is used to prevent clot blockage. If the chest tube doesn t improvethe patient s condition, they may need a thoracotomy to evacuate blood andclots and to control bleeding.Special Considerations Give oxygen by face mask or nasal cannula. Give IV. fluids and blood transfusions, as ordered, to treat shock. Monitorpulse oximetry and ABG levels often. Explain all procedures to the patient to allay their fears. Assist withthoracentesis. Wam the patient not to cough during this procedure. Carefully observe chest tube drainage and record the volume drained (atleast every hour). Milk the chest tube (only if necessary and according tofacility and physician protocols) to keep it open and free from clots. If thetube is warm and full of blood and the bloody fluid level in the water-sealbottle is rising rapidly, report this at once. The patient may need immediatesurgery. Watch the patient closely for pallor and gasping respirations. Monitor vitalsigns diligently. Falling blood pressure, rising pulse rate, and risingrespiratory rate may indicate shock or massive bleeding.PULMONARY HYPERTENSIONPulmonary hypertension occurs when PAP rises above normal for reasonsother than aging or altitude. No definitive set of values is used to diagnosepulmonary hypertension, but the National Institutes of Health requires a mean PAP of 25 mm Hg or more. The prognosis depends on the cause of theunderlying disorder, but the long-term prognosis is poor. Within 5 years ofdiagnosis, only 25 of patients are still alive.Causes and Incidence Pulmonary hypertension begins as hypertrophy of the small pulmonaryarteries. The medial and intimal muscle layers of these vessels thicken,",21,106
292,"decreasing distensibility and increasing resistance. This disorder thenprogresses to vascular sclerosis and obliteration of small vessels.In most cases, pulmonary hypertension occurs secondary to an underlyingdisease process, including: alveolar hypoventilation from COPD (most common cause in the United States), sarcoidosis, diffuse interstitial disease, pulmonary metastasis, andcertain diseases such as scleroderma. (In these disorders, pulmonaryvascular resistance occurs secondary to hypoxemia and destruction of thealveolocapillary bed. Other disorders that cause alveolar hypoventilationwithout lung tissue damage include obesity, kyphoscoliosis, andobstructive sleep apnea.) vascular obstruction from pulmonary embolism, vasculitis, and disordersthat cause obstruction of small or large pulmonary veins, such as left atrialmyxoma, idiopathic venoocclusive disease, fibrosing mediastinitis, andmediastinal neoplasm primary cardiac disease, which may be congenital or acquired. Congenitaldefects that cause left-to-right shunting of blood such as patent ductusarteriosus or atrial or ventricular septal defect increase blood flow intothe lungs and, consequently, raise pulmonary vascular pressure. Acquiredcardiac diseases, such as rheumatic valvular disease and mitral stenosis,increase pulmonary venous pressure by restricting blood flow retuming tothe heart Primary (or idiopathic) pulmonary hypertension is rare, occurring mostcommonly and with no known cause in women between 20 and 40 yearsold. Secondary pulmonary hypertension results from existing cardiac,pulmonary, thromboembolic, or collagen vascular diseases or from the use ofcertain drugs.Pathophysiology The primary pathogenic mechanism involved in pulmonary hypertension isvascular resistance. This resistance typically results from vasoconstriction,remodeling, or a formation of a microthrombus in the pulmonary arteries orarterioles.Complications Cor pulmonale",9,89
293,"Cardiac failure Cardiac arrest Signs and Symptoms Most patients complain of increasing dyspnea on exertion, weakness, syncope,and fatigability. Many also show signs of right-sided heart failure, includingperipheral edema, ascites, jugular vein distention, and hepatomegaly. Otherclinical effects vary with the underlying disorder.Diagnosis Characteristic diagnostic findings include: Auscultation reveals abnormalities associated with the underlyingdisorder. ABG analysis indicates hypoxemia (decreased Pao,). Electrocardiography shows right axis deviation and tall or peaked P wavesin inferior leads in the patient with right ventricular hypertrophy. Cardiac catheterization reveals pulmonary systolic pressure above 30 mm Hg as well as increased PAWP if the underlying cause is left atrialmyxoma, mitral stenosis, or left-sided heart failure (otherwise normal). Pulmonary angiography detects filling defects in pulmonary vasculaturesuch as those that develop in patients with pulmonary emboli. PFTs may show decreased flow rates and increased residual volume inunderlying obstructive disease and decreased TLC in underlying restrictivedisease.Treatment Treatment usually includes oxygen therapy to decrease hypoxemia andresulting pulmonary vascular resistance. It may also include vasodilatortherapy (nifedipine Procardia , diltiazem Cardizem , or prostaglandin E).For patients with right-sided heart failure, treatment also includes fluidrestriction, cardiac glycosides to increase cardiac output, and diuretics todecrease intravascular volume and extravascular fluid accumulation.Treatment also aims to correct the underlying cause.Some patients with pulmonary hypertension may be candidates for heart lung transplantation to improve their chances of survival.",9,85
294,"Special Considerations Pulmonary hypertension requires keen observation and careful monitoring aswell as skilled supportive care. Administer oxygen therapy as ordered and observe the patient s response.Report any signs of increasing dyspnea to the physician so they can adjusttreatment accordingly. Monitor ABG levels for acidosis and hypoxemia. Report any change in thepatient s level of consciousness at once. When caring for a patient with right-sided heart failure, especially onereceiving diuretics, record their weight daily, carefully measure intake andoutput, and explain all medications and diet restrictions. Check forworsening jugular vein distention, which may indicate fluid overload. Monitor the patient s vital signs, especially blood pressure and heart rate.Watch for hypotension and tachycardia. If they have a pulmonary arterycatheter, check PAP and PAWP, as indicated. Report any changes. Before discharge, help the patient adjust to the limitations imposed by thisdisorder. Advise against overexertion and suggest frequent rest periodsbetween activities. Refer the patient to the social services department ifthey will need special equipment, such as oxygen equipment, for home use.Make sure that they understand the prescribed medications and diet and theneed to weigh themselves daily.PLEURAL EFFUSION AND EMPYEMAPleural effusion is an excess of fluid in the pleural space. Normally, this spacecontains a small amount of extracellular fluid that lubricates the pleuralsurfaces. Increased production or inadequate removal of this fluid results inpleural effusion. Empyema is the accumulation of pus and necrotic tissue inthe pleural space. Blood (hemothorax) and chyle (chylothorax) may alsocollect in this space.Causes and Incidence The balance of osmotic and hydrostatic pressures in parietal pleuralcapillaries normally results in fluid movement into the pleural space.Balanced pressures in visceral pleural capillaries promote reabsorption ofthis fluid. Effusions frequently result from heart failure, hepatic disease with",17,113
295,"ascites, peritoneal dialysis, hypoalbuminemia, and disorders resulting inoverexpanded intravascular volume.Exudative pleural effusions occur with TB, subphrenic abscess,pancreatitis, bacterial or fungal pneumonitis or empyema, malignancy,pulmonary embolism with or without infarction, collagen disease (LE andrheumatoid arthritis), myxedema, and chest trauma.Empyema is usually associated with infection in the pleural space. Suchinfection may be idiopathic or may be related to pneumonitis, carcinoma,perforation, or esophageal rupture.Pathophysiology Pleural effusions result from excessive hydrostatic pressure or decreasedosmotic pressure causing excessive amounts of fluid to pass across intactcapillaries. The result is a transudative pleural effusion, an ultrafiltrate ofplasma containing low concentrations of protein. Exudative pleural effusionsresult when capillaries exhibit increased permeability with or withoutchanges in hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures, allowing protein-richfluid to leak into the pleural space. An empyema results from an infection inthe pleural space or accumulated fluid.Complications Atelectasis Infection Hypoxemia Signs and Symptoms Patients with pleural effusion characteristically display symptoms relating tothe underlying pathologic condition. Most patients with large effusions,particularly those with underlying pulmonary disease, complain of dyspnea.Those with effusions associated with pleurisy complain of pleuritic chestpain. Other clinical features depend on the cause of the effusion. Patients withempyema also develop fever and malaise.Diagnosis Auscultation of the chest reveals decreased breath sounds; percussion detectsdullness over the effused area, which doesn t change with breathing. Chest X-ray shows fluid in dependent regions. However, diagnosis also requires other",10,99
296,"tests to distinguish transudative from exudative effusions and to help pinpointthe underlying disorder.The most useful test is thoracentesis, in which pleural fluid is analyzed inthe laboratory to show components. Acute inflammatory WBCs andmicroorganisms may be evident in empyema.In addition, if a pleural effusion results from esophageal rupture orpancreatitis, fluid amylase levels are usually higher than serum levels.Aspirated fluid may be tested for LE cells, antinuclear antibodies, andneoplastic cells. It may also be analyzed for color and consistency; acid-fastbacillus (AFB), fungal, and bacterial cultures; and triglycerides (inchylothorax). Cell analysis shows leukocytosis in empyema. A negativetuberculin skin test strongly rules against TB as the cause. In exudative pleuraleffusions in which thoracentesis isn t definitive, pleural biopsy may be done.This is particularly useful for confirming TB or malignancy.Treatment Depending on the amount of fluid present, symptomatic effusion may requirethoracentesis to remove fluid or careful monitoring of the patient s ownreabsorption of the fluid. Hemothorax requires drainage to prevent fibrothoraxformation. Pleural effusions associated with lung cancer commonlyreaccumulate quickly. If a chest tube is inserted to drain the fluid, a sclerosingagent, such as talc, may be injected through the tube to cause adhesionsbetween the parietal and visceral pleura, thereby obliterating the potentialspace for fluid to recollect.Treatment of empyema requires insertion of one or more chest tubes afterthoracentesis, to allow drainage of purulent material, and possiblydecortication (surgical removal of the thick coating over the lung) or ribresection to allow open drainage and lung expansion. Empyema also requiresparenteral antibiotics. Associated hypoxia requires oxygen administration.Special Considerations Explain thoracentesis to the patient. Before the procedure, tell the patient toexpect a stinging sensation from the local anesthetic and a feeling ofpressure when the needle is inserted. Instruct them to tell you immediatelyif they feel uncomfortable or has difficulty breathing during the procedure. Reassure the patient during thoracentesis. Remind them to breathe normallyand avoid sudden movements, such as coughing or sighing. Monitor vital",16,112
297,"signs and watch for syncope. If fluid is removed too quickly, the patientmay suffer bradycardia, hypotension, pain, pulmonary edema, or evencardiac arrest. Watch for respiratory distress or pneumothorax (suddenonset of dyspnea and cyanosis) after thoracentesis. Administer oxygen and, in empyema, antibiotics, as ordered. Encourage the patient to perform deep-breathing exercises to promote lungexpansion. Use an incentive spirometer to promote deep breathing. Provide meticulous chest tube care, and use sterile technique for changingdressings around the tube insertion site in empyema. Ensure tube patencyby watching for fluctuations of fluid or air bubbling in the underwater sealchamber. Continuous bubbling may indicate an air leak. Record the amount,color, and consistency of any tube drainage. If the patient has open drainage through a rib resection or intercostal tube,use hand and dressing precautions. Because weeks of such drainage areusually necessary to obliterate the space, make visiting nurse referrals forthe patient who will be discharged with the tube in place. If pleural effusion was a complication of pneumonia or influenza, adviseprompt medical attention for upper respiratory infections.PLEURISYPleurisy, also known as pleuritis, is an inflammation of the visceral andparietal pleurae that line the inside of the thoracic cage and envelop the lungs.Causes and Incidence Pleurisy develops as a complication of pneumonia, TB, viruses, systemic LE,rheumatoid arthritis, uremia, Dressler syndrome, certain cancers, pulmonaryinfarction, and chest trauma. Pleuritic pain is caused by the inflammation orirritation of sensory nerve endings in the parietal pleura. As the lungs inflateand deflate, the visceral pleura covering the lungs moves against the fixedparietal pleura lining the pleural space, causing pain. This disorder usuallybegins suddenly.In the United States, pleural effusions develop in 36 to 66 ofhospitalized patients with bacterial pneumonia.Pathophysiology There are pain fibers located in the two layers of the pleura; the visceralpleural covers the lung and the parietal pleural line the inner chest wall.",16,119
298,"Pleurisy or pleuritis is the result of the inflammation of these pleuritic layers,usually from an infectious source.Complications Pneumonia Pleural effusion Lung collapse Signs and Symptoms Sharp, stabbing pain that increases with deep breathing may be so severe thatit limits movement on the affected side. Dyspnea also occurs. Other symptomsvary according to the underlying pathologic process.Diagnosis Auscultation of the chest reveals a characteristic pleural friction rub acoarse, creaky sound heard during late inspiration and early expiration,directly over the area of pleural inflammation. Palpation over the affectedarea may reveal coarse vibration. Chest X-ray, ultrasound of the chest, andthoracentesis may aid in diagnosis.Treatment Treatment is directed at the underlying cause; bacterial infections are treatedwith appropriate antibiotics, TB requires special treatment, and viralinfections may be permitted to run their course. Treatment also includesmeasures to relieve symptoms, such as anti-inflammatory agents, analgesics,and bed rest. Severe pain may require an intercostal nerve block of two orthree intercostal nerves. Pleurisy with pleural effusion calls for thoracentesisas a therapeutic and diagnostic measure.Special Considerations Stress the importance of bed rest and plan your care to allow the patient asmuch uninterrupted rest as possible. Administer antitussives and pain medication, as ordered, but be careful notto overmedicate. If the pain requires an opioid analgesic, wam the patientwho s about to be discharged to avoid overuse because such medicationdepresses coughing and respiration.",10,77
299,"Encourage the patient to cough. Tell them to apply firm pressure at the siteof the pain during coughing exercises to minimize pain.Chronic Disorders CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASECOPD is chronic airway obstruction that results from emphysema, chronicbronchitis, asthma, or any combination of these disorders. (See Howpulmonary edema develops, page 131. Also see Lung changes inemphysema, page 132.) Usually, more than one of these underlying conditionscoexist; in most cases, bronchitis and emphysema occur together. It doesn talways produce symptoms and causes only minimal disability in manypatients. However, COPD tends to worsen with time.Lung Changes in Emphysema A form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema is theabnormal, permanent enlargement of the acini accompanied by thedestruction of the alveolar walls. Obstruction results from tissue changes,rather than mucus production, as occurs in asthma and chronic bronchitis.The distinguishing characteristic of emphysema is airflow limitationcaused by a lack of elastic recoil in the lungs.",8,54
300,"Dilation anddestruction ofbronchialwallslung tissue Causes and Incidence Predisposing factors include cigarette smoking, recurrent or chronicrespiratory infections, air pollution, occupational exposure to chemicals, andallergies. Early inflammatory changes may reverse if the patient stops smoking",2,17
301,"before lung destruction is extensive. Familial and hereditary factors (such asdeficiency of alpha,-antitrypsin) may also predispose a person to COPD.The most common chronic lung disease, COPD (also known as chronicobstructive lung disease) affects an estimated 17 million Americans, and itsincidence is rising. It affects more males than females, probably because untilrecently men were more likely to smoke heavily. COPD occurs mostly inpeople older than age 40.Pathophysiology Repeated exposure to carcinogens, such as smoking, is by far the mostimportant causative action it impairs ciliary action and macrophagefunction, inflames airways, increases mucus production, destroys alveolarseptae, and causes peribronchiolar fibrosis.Complications Overwhelming disability Cor pulmonale Severe respiratory failure Death Signs and Symptoms The typical patient, a long-term cigarette smoker, has no symptoms untilmiddle age. The ability to exercise or do strenuous work gradually starts todecline, and the patient begins to develop a productive cough. These signs aresubtle at first but become more pronounced as the patient gets older and thedisease progresses. Eventually the patient may develop dyspnea on minimalexertion, frequent respiratory infections, intermittent or continuous hypoxemia,and grossly abnormal pulmonary function studies. Advanced COPD may causesevere dyspnea, overwhelming disability, cor pulmonale, severe respiratoryfailure, and death.Diagnosis For specific diagnostic tests used to determine COPD, see Types of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease.Treatment",8,80
302,"Treatment is designed to relieve symptoms and prevent complications.Because most patients with COPD receive outpatient treatment, they needcomprehensive teaching to help them comply with therapy and understand thenature of this chronic, progressive disease. If programs in pulmonaryrehabilitation are available, encourage patient to enroll.Urge the patient to stop smoking. Provide smoking cessation counseling orrefer them to a program. Avoid other respiratory irritants, such as secondhandsmoke, aerosol spray products, and outdoor air pollution. An air conditionerwith an air filter in the home may be helpful.The patient is usually treated with beta-agonist bronchodilators (albuterolor salmeterol), anticholinergic bronchodilators (ipratropium), andcorticosteroids (beclomethasone or triamcinolone). These are usually givenby metered-dose inhaler, requiring that the patient be taught the correctadministration technique.Antibiotics are used to treat respiratory infections. Stress the need tocomplete the prescribed course of antibiotic therapy.Special Considerations Teach the patient and family how to recognize early signs of infection;wam the patient to avoid contact with people with respiratory infections.Encourage good oral hygiene to help prevent infection. Pneumococcalvaccination and annual influenza vaccinations are important preventivemeasures. To promote ventilation and reduce air trapping, teach the patient to breatheslowly, prolong expirations to two to three times the duration ofinspiration, and to exhale through pursed lips. To help mobilize secretions, teach the patient how to cough effectively. Ifthe patient with copious secretions has difficulty mobilizing secretions,teach his or her family how to perform postural drainage and chestphysiotherapy. If secretions are thick, urge the patient to drink 12 to 15glasses of fluid per day. A home humidifier may be beneficial, particularlyin the winter.Administer low concentrations of oxygen as ordered. Perform blood gasanalysis to determine the patient s oxygen needs and to avoid CO, narcosis.If the patient is to continue oxygen therapy at home, teach them how to usethe equipment correctly. The patient with COPD rarely requires more than2 to 3 L/minute to maintain adequate oxygenation. Higher flow rates will",16,117
303,"further increase the Pao,, but the patient whose ventilatory drive is largelybased on hypoxemia commonly develops markedly increased Paco,,. Inthese cases, chemoreceptors in the brain are relatively insensitive to theincrease in CO,. Teach the patient and family that excessive oxygen therapymay eliminate the hypoxic respiratory drive, causing confusion anddrowsiness, signs of CO, narcosis. Emphasize the importance of a balanced diet. Because the patient may tireeasily when eating, suggest that they eat frequent, small meals and considerusing oxygen, administered by nasal cannula, during meals. Help the patient and family adjust their lifestyles to accommodate thelimitations imposed by this debilitating chronic disease. Instruct the patientto allow for daily rest periods and to exercise daily as the providerdirects. As COPD progresses, encourage the patient to discuss their fears. To help prevent COPD, advise all patients, especially those with a familyhistory of COPD or those in its early stages, not to smoke. Assist in the early detection of COPD by urging persons to have periodicphysical examinations, including spirometry and medical evaluation of achronic cough, and to seek treatment for recurring respiratory infectionspromptly. Lung volume reduction surgery is a new procedure for carefully selectedpatients with primarily emphysema. Nonfunctional parts of the lung (tissuefilled with disease and providing little ventilation or perfusion) aresurgically removed. Removal allows more functional lung tissue to expandand the diaphragm to retum to its normally elevated position.BRONCHIECTASISA condition marked by chronic abnormal dilation of bronchi and destructionof bronchial walls, bronchiectasis can occur throughout the tracheobronchialtree or can be confined to one segment or lobe. However, it s usually bilateraland involves the basilar segments of the lower lobes. This disease has threeforms: cylindrical (fusiform), varicose, and saccular (cystic). Bronchiectasisis irreversible once established.Causes and Incidence Because of the availability of antibiotics to treat acute respiratory tractinfections, the incidence of bronchiectasis has dramatically decreased in the",16,112
304,"past 20 years. Incidence is highest among Eskimos and the Maoris of New Zealand. It affects people of both sexes and all ages.The different forms of bronchiectasis may occur separately orsimultaneously. In cylindrical bronchiectasis, the bronchi expand unevenly,with little change in diameter, and end suddenly in a squared-off fashion. Invaricose bronchiectasis, abnormal, irregular dilation and narrowing of thebronchi give the appearance of varicose veins. In saccular bronchiectasis,many large dilations end in sacs. These sacs balloon into pus-filled cavitiesas they approach the periphery and are then called saccules. (See Forms ofbronchial dilatation, page 134.)Forms of Bronchial Dilatation Dilatations of the air sacs occur because of bronchiectasis, as depictedbelow.Saccular Varicose Cylindrical",9,36
305,"This disease results from conditions associated with repeated damage tobronchial walls and abnormal mucociliary clearance, which cause abreakdown of supporting tissue adjacent to airways. Such conditions include: cystic fibrosisimmunologic disorders (e.g., agammaglobulinemia) recurrent, inadequately treated bacterial respiratory tract infections, suchas TB, and complications of measles, pneumonia, pertussis, or influenza obstruction (by a foreign body most common in children , tumor, orstenosis) in association with recurrent infection inhalation of corrosive gas or repeated aspiration of gastric juices into thelungs congenital anomalies (uncommon), such as bronchomalacia, congenitalbronchiectasis, immotile cilia syndrome, and Kartagener syndrome, avariant of immotile cilia syndrome characterized by situs inversus,bronchiectasis, and either nasal polyps or sinusitis Pathophysiology In bronchiectasis, hyperplastic squamous epithelium denuded of cilia replacesulcerated columnar epithelium. Abscess formation involving all layers of thebronchial wall produces inflammatory cells and fibrous tissue, resulting indilation and narrowing of the airways. Mucus plugs or fibrous tissueobliterates smaller bronchioles, whereas peribronchial lymphoid tissuebecomes hyperplastic. Extensive vascular proliferation of bronchialcirculation occurs and produces frequent hemoptysis.Complications Chronic malnutrition Amyloidosis Right ventricular failure Cor pulmonale Signs and Symptoms Initially, bronchiectasis may be asymptomatic. When symptoms do arise,they re commonly attributed to other illnesses. The patient usually complainsof frequent bouts of pneumonia or hemoptysis. The classic symptom, however,",8,86
306,"is a chronic cough that produces foul-smelling, mucopurulent secretions inamounts ranging from less than 10 m L/day to more than 150 m L/day.Cough and sputum production are observed in greater than 90 ofbronchiectasis patients. Characteristic findings include coarse crackles duringinspiration over involved lobes or segments, occasional wheezing, dyspnea,sinusitis, weight loss, anemia, malaise, clubbing, recurrent fever, chills, andother signs of infection.Advanced bronchiectasis may produce chronic malnutrition as well asright-sided heart failure and cor pulmonale because of hypoxic pulmonaryvasoconstriction.Diagnosis A history of recurrent bronchial infections, pneumonia, and hemoptysis in apatient whose chest X-rays show peribronchial thickening, areas ofatelectasis, and scattered cystic changes suggest bronchiectasis.In recent years, CT scanning has supplanted bronchography as the mostuseful diagnostic test for bronchiectasis. It s sometimes used with high-resolution techniques to better determine anatomic changes. Bronchoscopydoesn t establish the diagnosis of bronchiectasis, but it does help to identifythe source of secretions. Bronchoscopy can also be instrumental in pinpointingthe site of bleeding in hemoptysis.Other helpful laboratory tests include: sputum culture and Gram stain to identify predominant organisms complete blood count to detect anemia and leukocytosis PFTs to detect decreased vital capacity, expiratory flow rate, andhypoxemia. These tests also help determine the physiologic severity of thedisease and the effects of therapy and help evaluate patients for surgery When cystic fibrosis is suspected as the underlying cause of bronchiectasis,a sweat electrolyte test is useful.Treatment Treatment includes antibiotics, given orally or IV. for 7 to 10 days or untilsputum production decreases. Bronchodilators, combined with posturaldrainage and chest percussion, help remove secretions if the patient hasbronchospasm and thick, tenacious sputum. Bronchoscopy may be used toremove obstruction and secretions. Hypoxia requires oxygen therapy; severe",10,106
307,"hemoptysis commonly requires lobectomy, segmental resection, or bronchialartery embolization if pulmonary function is poor. Long-term antibiotictherapy isn t appropriate because it may predispose the patient to seriousgram-negative infections and resistant organisms.Special Considerations Provide supportive care and help the patient adjust to the permanentchanges in lifestyle that irreversible lung damage necessitates. Thoroughteaching is vital. Administer antibiotics as ordered and explain all diagnostic tests. Performchest physiotherapy, including postural drainage and chest percussiondesigned for involved lobes, several times a day. The best times to do thisare early moming and just before bedtime. Instruct the patient to maintaineach position for 10 minutes, and then perform percussion and tell them tocough. Show family members how to perform postural drainage andpercussion. Also teach the patient coughing and deep-breathing techniquesto promote good ventilation and the removal of secretions. Advise the patient to stop smoking, if appropriate, to avoid stimulatingsecretions and irritating the airways. Refer them to a local self-help group. Provide a warm, quiet, comfortable environment, and urge the patient torest as much as possible. Encourage balanced, high-protein meals topromote good health and tissue healing and plenty of fluids (2 to 3 qt 2 to3 L )/day to hydrate and thin bronchial secretions. Give frequent mouthcare to remove foul-smelling sputum. Teach the patient to dispose of allsecretions properly. Instruct them to seek prompt attention for respiratoryinfections. Tell the patient to avoid air pollutants and people with upper respiratorytract infections. Instruct them to take medications (especially antibiotics)exactly as prescribed.HITEM PREVENTION Treat bacterial pneumonia vigorously. Stress the need for immunization to prevent childhood diseases.IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS",19,84
308,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and usually fatal interstitialpulmonary disease. About 50 of patients with IPF die within 5 years ofdiagnosis. Once thought to be a rare condition, it s now diagnosed with muchgreater frequency. IPF has been known by several other names over the years,including cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, diffuse interstitial fibrosis,idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis, and Hamman-Rich syndrome.Causes and Incidence IPF is the result of a cascade of events that involve inflammatory, immune, andfibrotic processes in the lung. However, despite many studies and hypotheses,the stimulus that begins the progression remains unknown. Speculation hasrevolved around viral and genetic causes, but no good evidence has beenfound to support either theory. However, it s clear that chronic inflammationplays an important role. Inflammation develops the injury and the fibrosis thatultimately distorts and impairs the structure and function of thealveolocapillary gas exchange surface.IPF is slightly more common in men than in women and is more common insmokers than in nonsmokers. It usually affects people 50 to 70 years old.Pathophysiology IPF pathophysiology is thought to be initiated when alveolar epithelial cellssignal an injury and then activates the excessive formation of fibroblastmigration and differentiation. Scarring to the lung structures occurs when thefibroblasts and myofibroblasts secrete large amounts of extracellular matrixproteins, such as collagens, decreasing the overall lung volume.Complications Respiratory failure Pneumonia Hypoxemia Pneumothorax Pulmonary hypertension Signs and Symptoms The usual presenting symptoms of IPF are dyspnea and a dry, hacking, andtypically paroxysmal cough. Most patients have had these symptoms forseveral months to 2 years before seeking medical help. Expiratory crackles,",12,93
309,"especially in the bases of the lungs, are usually heard early in the disease.Bronchial breath sounds appear later, when airway consolidation develops.Rapid, shallow breathing occurs, especially with exertion, and clubbing hasbeen noted in more than 40 of patients. Late in the disease, cyanosis andevidence of pulmonary hypertension (augmented S, and S, gallop) commonlyoccur. As the disease progresses, profound hypoxemia and severe, debilitatingdyspnea are the hallmark signs.Diagnosis Diagnosis begins with a thorough patient history to exclude a more commoncause of interstitial lung disease.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Lung biopsy is helpful in the diagnosis of IPFIn the past, an open lung biopsy was the only acceptable procedure, butnow biopsies may be done through a thoracoscope or bronchoscope.Histologic features of the biopsy tissue vary, depending on the stage of thedisease and other factors that aren t yet completely understood. The alveolarwalls are swollen with chronic inflammatory cellular infiltrate composed ofmononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Intra-alveolarinflammatory cells may be found in early stages. As the disease progresses,excessive collagen and fibroblasts fill the interstitium. In advanced stages,alveolar walls are destroyed and are replaced by honeycombing cysts.Chest X-rays may show one of four distinct pattems: interstitial,reticulonodular, ground-glass, or honeycomb. Although chest X-rays arehelpful in identifying the presence of an abnormality, they don t correlate wellwith histologic findings or PFTs in determining the severity of the disease.They also don t help distinguish inflammation from fibrosis. However, serial X-rays may help track the progression of the disease.High-resolution CT scans provide superior views of the four pattems seenon routine X-ray film and are used routinely to help establish the diagnosis of IPF. Research is currently underway to determine whether the four pattems ofabnormality seen on these scans correlate with responsiveness to treatment.PFTs show reductions in vital capacity and TLC and impaired diffusingcapacity for carbon monoxide. ABG analysis and pulse oximetry revealhypoxemia, which may be mild when the patient is at rest early in the diseasebut may become severe later in the disease. Oxygenation will alwaysdeteriorate, usually to a severe level, with exertion. Serial PFTs (especially",13,115
310,"carbon monoxide diffusing capacity) and ABG values may help track thecourse of the disease and the patient s response to treatment.Treatment Although it can t change the pathophysiology of IPF, oxygen therapy canprevent the problems related to dyspnea and tissue hypoxia in the early stagesof the disease process. The patient may require little or no supplementaloxygen while at rest initially, but he or she will need more as the diseaseprogresses and during exertion.No known cure exists. Corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs may be given tosuppress inflammation but are usually unsuccessful. Recently, interferongamma-1b has shown some promise in treating the disease.Lung transplantation may be successful for younger, otherwise healthyindividuals.Special Considerations Explain all diagnostic tests to the patient, who may experience anxiety andfrustration about the many tests required to establish the diagnosis. Monitor oxygenation at rest and with exertion. The physician mayprescribe one oxygen flow rate for use when the patient is at rest and ahigher one for use during exertion to maintain adequate oxygenation.Instruct the patient to increase oxygen flow rate to the appropriate level forexercise. As IPF progresses, the patient s oxygen requirements will increase. Theymay need a nonrebreathing mask to supply high oxygen percentages.Eventually, maintaining adequate oxygenation may become impossibledespite maximum oxygen flow. Most patients will need oxygen at home. Make appropriate referrals todischarge plamners, respiratory care practitioners, and home equipmentvendors to ensure continuity of care. Teach breathing, relaxation, and energy conservation techniques to help thepatient manage severe dyspnea. Encourage the patient to be as active as possible. Refer them to apulmonary rehabilitation program. Monitor the patient for adverse reactions to drug therapy. Teach the patient about prescribed medications, especially adverse effects.Teach the patient and their family members infection prevention techniques.",15,89
311,"Encourage good nutritional habits. Small, frequent meals with highnutritional value may be necessary if dyspnea interferes with eating. Provide emotional support for the patient and their family as they deal withthe patient s increasing disability, dyspnea, and probable death. Consulthospice as appropriate.TUBERCULOSISAn acute or chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, TB ischaracterized by pulmonary infiltrates, formation of granulomas withcaseation, fibrosis, and cavitation. (See Understanding tuberculosisinvasion.) People who live in crowded, poorly ventilated conditions andthose who are immunocompromised are most likely to become infected. Inpatients with strains that are sensitive to the usual antitubercular agents, theprognosis is excellent with correct treatment. However, in those with strainsthat are resistant to two or more of the major antitubercular agents, mortalityis 50 .PATHOPHYSIOLOGYUNDERSTANDING TUBERCULOSIS INVASIONAfter infected droplets are inhaled, they enter the lungs and aredeposited either in the lower part of the upper lobe or in the upper part ofthe lower lobe. Leukocytes surround the droplets, which leads toinflammation. As part of the inflammatory response, some mycobacteriaare carried off in the lymphatic circulation by the lymph nodes.",10,63
312,"Tubercular: Tracheaorganisms Lymphnodes Bifurcation Bronchi Horizontalfissure Obliquefissure Causes and Incidence After exposure to M. tuberculosis, roughly 5 of infected people developactive TB within 1 year; in the remainder, microorganisms cause a latentinfection. The host s immune system usually controls the tubercle bacillus byenclosing it in a tiny nodule (tubercle). The bacillus may lie dormant withinthe tubercle for years and later reactivate and spread.Although the primary infection site is the lungs, mycobacteria commonlyexist in other parts of the body. Several factors increase the risk of infectionreactivation: gastrectomy, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, Hodgkin lymphoma,leukemia, silicosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, treatment withcorticosteroids or immunosuppressants, and advanced age.Cell-mediated immunity to the mycobacteria, which develops 3 to 6 weekslater, usually contains the infection and arrests the disease. If the infectionreactivates, the body s response characteristically leads to caseation theconversion of necrotic tissue to a cheese-like material. The caseum maylocalize, undergo fibrosis, or excavate and form cavities, the walls of which",6,62
313,"are studded with multiplying tubercle bacilli. If this happens, infected caseousdebris may spread throughout the lungs by the tracheobronchial tree. Sites ofextrapulmonary TB include the pleurae, meninges, joints, lymph nodes,peritoneum, genitourinary tract, and bowel.The incidence of TB has been increasing in the United States secondary tohomelessness, drug abuse, and human immunodeficiency virus infection.Globally, TB is the leading infectious cause of morbidity and mortality,generating 8 to 10 million new cases each year.Pathophysiology Transmission is by droplet nuclei produced when infected persons cough orsneeze. Persons with a cavitary lesion are particularly infectious because theirsputum usually contains 1 to 100 million bacilli per milliliter. If an inhaledtubercle bacillus settles in an alveolus, infection occurs, withalveolocapillary dilation and endothelial cell swelling. Alveolitis results,with replication of tubercle bacilli and influx of polymorphonuclearleukocytes. These organisms spread through the lymph system to thecirculatory system and then through the body.Complications Respiratory failure Bronchopleural fistulas Pneumothorax Hemorrhage Pleural effusion Pneumonia Signs and Symptoms After an incubation period of 4 to 8 weeks, TB is usually asymptomatic inprimary infection but may produce nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue,weakness, anorexia, weight loss, night sweats, and low-grade fever.3 ELDER TIP Fever and night sweats, the typical hallmarks of TB, maynot be present in elderly patients, who instead may exhibit a changein activity or weight. Assess older patients carefully.In reactivation, symptoms may include a cough that producesmucopurulent sputum, occasional hemoptysis, and chest pains.",8,99
314,"Diagnosisfey CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Diagnostic tests include chest X-rays, atuberculin skin test, and sputum smears and cultures to identify M.tuberculosis. The diagnosis must be precise because several other diseases(such as lung cancer, lung abscess, pneumoconiosis, and bronchiectasis)may mimic TB.These procedures aid in diagnosis: Auscultation detects crepitant crackles, bronchial breath sounds, wheezing,and whispered pectoriloquy. Chest percussion detects dullness over the affected area, indicatingconsolidation or pleural fluid. Chest X-ray shows nodular lesions, patchy infiltrates (mainly in upperlobes), cavity formation, scar tissue, and calcium deposits; however, it maynot be able to distinguish active from inactive TB. Tuberculin skin test detects TB infection. Intermediate-strength purifiedprotein derivative or 5 tuberculin units (0.1 m L) are injectedintracutaneously on the forearm. The test results are read in 48 to 72 hours;a positive reaction (induration of 5 to 15 mm or more, depending on riskfactors) develops 2 to 10 weeks after infection in active and inactive TB.However, severely immunosuppressed patients may never develop apositive reaction.fey CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Stains and cultures (of sputum, cerebrospinalfluid, urine, drainage from abscess, or pleural fluid) show heat-sensitive, nonmotile, aerobic, acid-fast bacilli.Treatment First-line agents for the treatment of TB are isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF),ethambutol (EMB), and pyrazinamide. Latent TB is usually treated with daily INH for 9 months. RIF daily for 4 months may be used for people with latent TB whose contacts are INH resistant. For most adults with active TB, therecommended dosing includes the administration of all four drugs daily for 2months, followed by 4 months of INH and RIF. Drug therapy must be selectedaccording to patient condition and organism susceptibility. Another first-linedrug used for TB is rifapentine. Second-line agents, such as cycloserine,",13,105
315,"ethionamide, p-aminosalicylic acid, streptomycin, and capreomycin, arereserved for special circumstances or drug-resistant strains. Interruption ofdrug therapy may require initiation of therapy from the beginning of theregimen or additional treatment.Directly observed therapy (DOT) may be selected or required. In thistherapy, an assigned caregiver directly observes the administration of thedrug. The goal of DOT is to monitor the treatment regimen and reduce thedevelopment of resistant organisms.Special Considerations Initiate AFB isolation precautions immediately for all patients suspected orconfirmed to have TB. AFB isolation precautions include the use ofaprivate room with negative pressure in relation to surrounding areas and aminimum of six air exchanges per hour (air should be exhausted directly tothe outside). Continue AFB isolation until there s clinical evidence of reducedinfectiousness (substantially decreased cough, fewer organisms onsequential sputum smears). Teach the infectious patient to cough and sneeze into tissues and to disposeof all secretions properly. Place a covered trash can nearby or tape a linedbag to the side of the bed to dispose of used tissues. Instruct the patient to wear a mask when outside his or her room. Visitors and staff members should wear particulate respirators that fitclosely around the face when they re in the patient s room. Remind the patient to get plenty of rest. Stress the importance of eatingbalanced meals to promote recovery. If the patient is anorexic, urge him orher to eat small meals frequently. Record weight weekly. Be alert for adverse effects of medications. Because INH sometimes leadsto hepatitis or peripheral neuritis, monitor aspartate aminotransferase andalanine aminotransferase levels. To prevent or treat peripheral neuritis,give pyridoxine (vitamin B,), as ordered. If the patient receives EMB,watch for optic neuritis; if it develops, discontinue the drug. If the patientreceives RIF, watch for hepatitis and purpura. Observe the patient for othercomplications, such as hemoptysis. Before discharge, advise the patient to watch for adverse effects from themedication and report them immediately. Emphasize the importance ofregular follow-up examinations. Instruct the patient and family conceming",23,117
316,"the signs and symptoms of recurring TB. Stress the need to follow long-term treatment faithfully. Emphasize to the patient the importance of taking the medications daily asprescribed. The patient may enroll ina supervised administration programto avoid the development of drug-resistant organisms. (See Preventingtuberculosis, page 139.)PREVENTIONPREVENTING TUBERCULOSISThe best way to prevent tuberculosis (TB) is early detection to preventit from becoming active. Hospitalized patients with TB should be isolatedfrom other patients using airbome precautions. Staff members should alsouse disposable high-efficiency particulate air filter masks, which serve asadequate respiratory protection when caring for patients who are inairbome isolation.Other ways to prevent the spread of TB include: Ifa patient has a weakened immune system or has humanimmunodeficiency virus, it is recommended that they receive annual TBtesting. Annual testing is also recommended for healthcare workers,those who work in a prison or a long-term care facility, and those witha substantially increased risk of exposure to the disease. Ifa patient tests positive for latent TB infection but has no evidence ofactive TB, he or she may be able to reduce the risk of developingactive TB by taking a course of therapy with isoniazid.To prevent the spread of disease from those with active TB or fromthose who are receiving treatment, the following recommendations shouldbe followed: Stress the need to maintain the treatment regimen and to not stop or skipdoses. When the treatment regimen is stopped, the TB bacteria canmutate and become drug resistant. The patient who is ona treatment regimen is still contagious until he orshe has been taking the medications for 2 to 3 weeks. Encouraging thepatient to stay indoors and home from school or work is recommended.",13,91
317,"If the patient must leave home, a mask is recommended during thisinitial treatment time to lessen the risk of transmission.Pneumoconioses SILICOSISSilicosis is a progressive disease characterized by nodular lesions thatcommonly progress to fibrosis. The most common form of pneumoconiosis,silicosis can be classified according to the severity of pulmonary disease andthe rapidity of its onset and progression. It usually occurs as a simpleasymptomatic illness.Acute silicosis develops after 1 to 3 years in workers exposed to very highconcentrations of respirable silica (sand blasters and tunnel workers).Accelerated silicosis appears after an average of 10 years of exposure tolower concentrations of free silica. Chronic silicosis develops after 20 ormore years of exposure to lower concentrations of free silica. (Chronicsilicosis is further subdivided into simple and complicated forms.)The prognosis is good unless the disease progresses into the complicatedfibrotic form, which causes respiratory insufficiency and cor pulmonale. It salso associated with pulmonary TB.Causes and Incidence Silicosis results from the inhalation and pulmonary deposition of respirablecrystalline silica dust, mostly from quartz. The danger to the worker dependson the concentration of dust in the atmosphere, the percentage of respirablefree silica particles in the dust, and the duration of exposure. Respirableparticles are less than 10 ym in diameter, but the disease-causing particlesdeposited in the alveolar space are usually to 3 um in diameter.Industrial sources of silica in its pure form include the manufacture ofceramics (flint) and building materials (sandstone). It occurs in mixed form inthe production of construction materials (cement). It s found in powder form(silica flour) in paints, porcelain, scouring soaps, and wood fillers as well asin the mining of gold, coal, lead, zinc, and iron. Foundry workers, boilerscalers, and stonecutters are all exposed to silica dust and, therefore, are athigh risk for developing silicosis.",12,101
318,"The incidence of silicosis has decreased since the Occupational Safety and Health Administration instituted regulations requiring the use of protectiveequipment that limits the amount of silica dust inhaled.Pathophysiology Nodules result when alveolar macrophages ingest silica particles, whichthey re unable to process. As a result, the macrophages die and releaseproteolytic enzymes into the surrounding tissue. The subsequent inflammationattracts other macrophages and fibroblasts into the region to produce fibroustissue and wall off the reaction. The resulting nodule has an onionskinappearance when viewed under a microscope. Nodules develop adjacent toterminal and respiratory bronchioles, concentrate in the upper lobes, and arecommonly accompanied by bullous changes in both lobes. If the diseaseprocess doesn t progress, minimal physiologic disturbances and no disabilityoccur. Occasionally, however, the fibrotic response accelerates, engulfing anddestroying large areas of the lung (progressive massive fibrosis orconglomerate lesions). Fibrosis may continue even after exposure to dust hasended.Complications Pulmonary fibrosis Cor pulmonale Ventricular or respiratory failure Pulmonary TBSigns and Symptoms Initially, silicosis may be asymptomatic or may produce dyspnea on exertion,usually attributed to being out of shape or slowing down. If the diseaseprogresses to the chronic and complicated stage, dyspnea on exertionworsens, and other symptoms usually tachypnea and an insidious dry coughthat s most pronounced in the moming appear.Progression to the advanced stage causes dyspnea on minimal exertion,worsening cough, and pulmonary hypertension, which in tum leads to right-sided heart failure and cor pulmonale. Patients with silicosis have a highincidence of active TB, which should be considered when evaluating patientswith this disease. CNS changes confusion, lethargy, and a decrease in the",11,96
319,"rate and depth of respiration as the Paco, increases also occur in advancedsilicosis.Other clinical features include malaise, disturbed sleep, and hoarseness.The severity of these symptoms may not correlate with chest X-ray findings orthe results of PFTs.Diagnosis The patient history reveals occupational exposure to silica dust. The physicalexamination is normal in simple silicosis; in chronic silicosis withconglomerate lesions, it may reveal decreased chest expansion, diminishedintensity of breath sounds, areas of hyporesonance and hyperresonance, fine tomedium crackles, and tachypnea.In simple silicosis, chest X-rays show small, discrete, nodular lesionsdistributed throughout both lung fields but typically concentrated in the upperlung zones; the hilar lung nodes may be enlarged and exhibit eggshell calcification. In complicated silicosis, X-rays show one or moreconglomerate masses of dense tissue.PFTs show: FVC treduced in complicated silicosis FEV, teduced in obstructive disease (emphysematous areas of silicosis);reduced in complicated silicosis, but ratio of FEV, to FVC is normal orhigh Maximal voluntary ventilation reduced in restrictive and obstructivediseases CO, diffusing capacity reduced when fibrosis destroys alveolar wallsand obliterates pulmonary capillaries or when fibrosis thickens thealveolocapillary membrane Treatment The goal of treatment is to relieve respiratory symptoms, to managehypoxemia and cor pulmonale, and to prevent respiratory tract irritation andinfections. Treatment also includes careful observation for the development of TB. Respiratory symptoms may be relieved through daily use of inhaledbronchodilators and increased fluid intake (at least 3 qt 3 L daily). Steaminhalation and chest physiotherapy techniques, such as controlled coughingand segmental bronchial drainage with chest percussion and vibration, help",6,102
320,"clear secretions. In severe cases, it may be necessary to administer oxygen bycannula or mask (1 to 2 L/minute) for the patient with chronic hypoxemia orby mechanical ventilation if arterial oxygen can t be maintained above 40 mm Hg. Respiratory infections require prompt administration of antibiotics.Special Considerations Teach the patient to prevent infections by avoiding crowds and personswith respiratory infections and by receiving influenza and pneumococcalvaccines.Increase exercise tolerance by encouraging regular activity. Advise thepatient to plan his or her daily activities to decrease the work of breathing.The patient should be instructed to pace himself or herself, rest often, andgenerally move slowly through his or her daily routine.ASBESTOSISAsbestosis is a form of pneumoconiosis characterized by diffuse interstitialfibrosis. It can develop as long as 15 to 20 years after regular exposure toasbestos has ended. Asbestos also causes pleural plaques and mesotheliomasof pleura and the peritoneum. A potent co-carcinogen, asbestos increases therisk of lung cancer in cigarette smokers.Causes and Incidence Asbestosis results from the inhalation of respirable asbestos fibers (50 wm ormore in length and 0.5 um or less in diameter), which assume a longitudinalorientation in the airway and move in the direction of airflow. The fiberspenetrate respiratory bronchioles and alveolar walls. Sources include themining and milling of asbestos, the construction industry, and the fireproofingand textile industries. Asbestos was also used in the production of paints,plastics, and brake and clutch linings.Asbestos-related diseases develop in families of asbestos workers as aresult of exposure to fibrous dust shaken off workers clothing at home. Suchdiseases develop in the general public as a result of exposure to fibrous dustor waste piles from nearby asbestos plants, but exposures for occupants oftypical buildings are quite low and not in a range associated with asbestosis.Inhaled fibers become encased in a brown, protein-like sheath rich in iron(ferruginous bodies or asbestos bodies), found in sputum and lung tissue.Interstitial fibrosis develops in lower lung zones, causing obliterative changes",11,107
321,"in lung parenchyma and pleurae. Raised hyaline plaques may form in parietalpleura, diaphragm, and pleura contiguous with the pericardium.Asbestosis occurs in 4 of every 10,000 people.Pathophysiology Asbestos fibers penetrate the pleura tissues and are phagocytosed permanentlywithin the lungs. This sets up cycles of cellular events and the release ofcytokines. The initial irritation occurs in the alveoli and initiates a surge ofasbestos-activated macrophages. These specified macrophages then producemultiple varieties of growth factors that interact to produce fibroblastproliferation.Complications Pulmonary fibrosis Respiratory failure Pulmonary hypertension Cor pulmonale Signs and Symptoms Clinical features may appear before chest X-ray changes. The first symptom isusually dyspnea on exertion, typically after 10 years exposure. As fibrosisextends, dyspnea on exertion increases until, eventually, dyspnea occurs evenat rest. Advanced disease also causes a dry cough (may be productive insmokers), chest pain (commonly pleuritic), recurrent respiratory infections,and tachypnea. (See A close look at asbestosis.)A Close Look at Asbestosis After years of exposure to asbestos, healthy lung tissue progresses fromsimple asbestosis to massive pulmonary fibrosis, as shown below.Simple asbestosis Progressive massive pulmonaryfibrosis",10,70
322,"Cardiovascular complications include pulmonary hypertension, rightventricular hypertrophy, and cor pulmonale. Finger clubbing commonlyoccurs.Diagnosis The patient history reveals occupational, family, or neighborhood exposure toasbestos fibers. Physical examination reveals characteristic dry crackles atlung bases. Chest X-rays show fine, irregular, and linear diffuse infiltrates;extensive fibrosis results in a honeycomb or ground-glass appearance. X-rays may also show pleural thickening and calcification, with bilateralobliteration of costophrenic angles. In later stages, an enlarged heart with aclassic shaggy heart border may be evident. CT scan of the lungs also aidsin diagnosis.PFTs show: Vital capacity, FVC, and TLC decreased FEV, decreased or normal Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity treduced when fibrosis destroysalveolar walls and thickens alveolocapillary membranes ABG analysis reveals:",7,49
323,"Pao, decreased Paco, low due to hyperventilation Treatment The goal of treatment is to relieve respiratory symptoms and, in advanceddisease, manage hypoxemia and cor pulmonale. Respiratory symptoms may berelieved by chest physiotherapy techniques, such as controlled coughing andsegmental bronchial drainage, chest percussion, and vibration. Aerosoltherapy, inhaled mucolytics, and increased fluid intake (at least 3 qt 3 L daily) may also relieve symptoms.Diuretics, cardiac glycosides, and salt restriction may be indicated forpatients with cor pulmonale. Hypoxemia requires oxygen administration bycannula or mask (1 to 2 L/minute) or by mechanical ventilation if arterialoxygen can t be maintained above 40 mm Hg, Respiratory infections requireprompt administration of antibiotics.Special Considerations Teach the patient to prevent infections by avoiding crowds and personswith infections and by receiving influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Improve the patient s ventilatory efficiency by encouraging physicalreconditioning, energy conservation in daily activities, and relaxationtechniques.COAL WORKER S PNEUMOCONIOSISA progressive nodular pulmonary disease, coal worker s pneumoconiosis(CWP) occurs in two forms. Simple CWP is characterized by small lungopacities; in complicated CWP, also known as progressive massive fibrosis,masses of fibrous tissue occasionally develop in the patient s lungs. The riskof developing CWP (also known as black lung disease, coal miner s disease,miner s asthma, anthracosis, and anthracosilicosis) depends on the durationof exposure to coal dust (usually 15 years or longer), intensity of exposure(dust count and particle size), location of the mine, silica content of the coal(anthracite coal has the highest silica content), and the worker s susceptibility.The prognosis varies. Simple asymptomatic disease is self-limiting,although progression to complicated CWP is more likely if CWP begins after",8,100
324,"a relatively short period of exposure. Complicated CWP may be disabling,resulting in severe ventilatory failure and cor pulmonale.Causes and Incidence CWP is caused by the inhalation and prolonged retention of respirable coaldust particles (less than 5 wm in diameter). Simple CWP results in theformation of macules (accumulations of macrophages laden with coal dust)around the terminal and respiratory bronchioles, surrounded by a halo ofdilated alveoli. Macule formation leads to atrophy of supporting tissue,causing permanent dilation of small airways (focal emphysema).Simple disease may progress to complicated CWP, involving one or bothlungs. In this form of the disease, fibrous tissue masses enlarge and coalesce,causing gross distortion of pulmonary structures (destruction of vasculaturealveoli and airways).The incidence of CWP is highest among anthracite coal miners in theeastem United States.Pathophysiology When coal dust particles are inhaled into the lung bronchioles, the carbon isphagocytosed and transported by macrophages and microciliary into themucus. An immune response is triggered as the coal-filled macrophagesaccumulate in the alveoli. Reticulin is secreted from the fibroblasts whichthen entrap the macrophages and become strangulated from the resultantinterstitial fibrosis.Complications Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary TB Cor pulmonale Signs and Symptoms Simple CWP produces no symptoms, especially in nonsmokers. Symptoms ofcomplicated CWP include exertional dyspnea and a cough that occasionallyproduces inky-black sputum (when fibrotic changes undergo avasculamecrosis and their centers cavitate). Other clinical features of CWP includeincreasing dyspnea and a cough that produces milky, gray, clear, or coal-",9,95
325,"flecked sputum. Recurrent bronchial and pulmonary infections produceyellow, green, or thick sputum.Complications include pulmonary hypertension, right ventricularhypertrophy, cor pulmonale, and pulmonary TB. In cigarette smokers, chronicbronchitis and emphysema may also complicate the disease.Diagnosis The patient history reveals exposure to coal dust. Physical examination showsbarrel chest, hyperresonant lungs with areas of dullness, diminished breathsounds, crackles, rhonchi, and wheezes. In simple CWP, chest X-rays showsmall opacities (less than 10 mm in diameter). These may be present in alllung zones but are more prominent in the upper lung zones. In complicated CWP, one or more large opacities (1 to 5 cm in diameter), possibly exhibitingcavitation, are seen.PFTs show: Vital capacity normal in simple CWP but decreased with complicated CWP FEV, decreased in complicated disease Residual volume and TLC normal in simple CWP; decreased incomplicated CWP Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity significantly decreased incomplicated CWP as alveolar septae are destroyed and pulmonarycapillaries obliterated Paco, may be increased with concomitant COPDTreatment There s no specific treatment. The goal of treatment is to relieve respiratorysymptoms, manage hypoxia and cor pulmonale, and avoid respiratory tractirritants and infections. Treatment also includes careful observation for thedevelopment of TB. Chest physiotherapy techniques, such as controlledcoughing and segmental bronchial drainage combined with chest percussionand vibration, help remove secretions.Other measures include increased fluid intake (at least 3 qt 3 L daily) andrespiratory therapy techniques, such as aerosol therapy, inhaled mucolytics,and intermittent positive-pressure breathing. Diuretics, cardiac glycosides,and salt restriction may be indicated in cor pulmonale. In severe cases, it maybe necessary to administer oxygen for hypoxemia by cannula or mask (1 to 2",12,101

331,"This intricate network of interlocking receptors and transmitters forms,together with the brain and spinal cord, a dynamic control system a livingcomputer that controls and regulates every mental and physical function.From birth to death, this astonishing system efficiently organizes the body saffairs controlling the smallest action, thought, or feeling; monitoringcommunication and instinct for survival; and allowing introspection, wonder,abstract thought, and awareness of one s own intelligence. The brain, theprimary center of the CNS, is the large soft mass of nervous tissue housed inthe cranium and protected and supported by the meninges and skull bones.The fragile brain, brainstem, and spinal cord are protected by bone (theskull and vertebrae), cushioning cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and threeprotective membranes, called meninges: The dura mater, or outer sheath, is made of tough white fibrous tissue.The arachnoid membrane, the middle layer, is delicate and lacelike. The pia mater, the inner meningeal layer, is made of fine blood vesselsheld together by connective tissue. It s thin and transparent and clings tothe brain and spinal cord surfaces, carrying branches of the cerebralarteries deep into the brain s fissures and sulci.Between the dura mater and the arachnoid membrane is the subduralspace; between the pia mater and the arachnoid membrane is thesubarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space and the brain s four ventriclescontain CSF, a clear liquid containing water and traces of organic materials(especially protein), glucose, and minerals.CSF is formed from blood in capillary networks called choroid plexus,which are located primarily in the brain s lateral ventricles. This fluid iseventually reabsorbed into the venous blood through the arachnoid villi, indural sinuses on the brain s surface.The cerebrum, the largest portion of the brain, is the nerve center thatcontrols sensory and motor activities and intelligence. The outer layer of thecerebrum, the cerebral cortex, consists of neuron cell bodies (gray matter);the inner layers consist of axons (white matter) and basal ganglia, whichcontrol motor coordination and steadiness. The cerebral surface is deeplyconvoluted, furrowed with elevations (gyri) and depressions (sulci). Alongitudinal fissure divides the cerebrum into two hemispheres connectedby a wide band of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum, through whichthe hemispheres share information. The hemispheres don t share equally; one",10,133
332,"always dominates, giving one side control over the other. Because motorimpulses descending from the brain through the pyramidal tract cross in themedulla, the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body and the lefthemisphere, the right side of the body. Several fissures divide the cerebruminto lobes, each of which is associated with specific functions. (See A /ookat the lobes, page 148.)A Look at the Lobes Several fissures divide the cerebrum into hemispheres and lobes; eachlobe has a specific function. The fissure of Sylvius (lateral sulcus)separates the temporal lobe from the frontal and parietal lobes. Thefissure of Rolando (central sulcus) separates the frontal lobes from theparietal lobe. The parieto-occipital fissure separates the occipital lobefrom the two parietal lobes.Parieto-occipitali Parietal lobefissuree Fissure of Fissure of Sylvius Rolando(lateral sulcus) (central sulcus)Frontal lobe Occipital lobe Temporal lobe",8,42
333,"The frontal lobe controls voluntary muscle movements and containsmotor areas (including the motor area for speech, or Broca area). It sthe center for personality, behavioral, and intellectual functions, suchas judgment, memory, and problem solving; for autonomic functions;and for cardiac and emotional responses. The temporal lobe is the center for taste, hearing, and smell; in thebrain s dominant hemisphere, it interprets spoken language. The parietal lobe coordinates and interprets sensory information fromthe opposite side of the body. The occipital lobe interprets visual stimuli.The thalamus, a relay center below the corpus callosum, further organizescerebral function by transmitting impulses to and from appropriate areas ofthe cerebrum. In addition to its primary relay function, it s responsible forprimitive emotional responses, such as fear, and for distinguishing pleasantstimuli from unpleasant ones.The hypothalamus, which lies beneath the thalamus, is an autonomiccenter that has connections with the brain, spinal cord, autonomic nervoussystem, and pituitary gland. It regulates temperature control, appetite, bloodpressure, breathing, sleep pattems, and peripheral nerve discharges thatoccur with behavioral and emotional expression. It also has partial control ofpituitary gland secretion and stress reaction.THE BASE OF THE BRAINBeneath the cerebrum, at the base of the brain, is the cerebellum. It sresponsible for smooth muscle movements, coordinating sensory impulseswith muscle activity, and maintaining muscle tone and equilibrium.The brainstem houses cell bodies for most of the cranial nerves andincludes the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. With thethalamus and the hypothalamus, it makes up a nerve network called thereticular formation, which acts as an arousal mechanism and controlswakefulness. It also relays nerve impulses between the spinal cord and otherparts of the brain. The midbrain is the reflex center for the third and fourthcranial nerves and mediates pupillary reflexes and eye movements. The ponshelps regulate respirations; it s also the reflex center for the fifth througheighth cranial nerves and mediates chewing, taste, saliva secretion, hearing,",13,111
334,"and equilibrium. The medulla oblongata affects cardiac, respiratory, andvasomotor functions.BLOODLINE TO THE BRAINFour major arteries two vertebral and two carotid supply the brain withoxygenated blood. These arteries originate in or near the aortic arch. The twovertebral arteries (branches of the subclavian) converge to become thebasilar artery, which supplies the posterior brain. The common carotidsbranch into the two intemal carotids, which divide further to supply theanterior brain and the middle brain. These arteries interconnect through thecircle of Willis, at the base of the brain. This anastomosis usually ensurescontinual circulation to the brain.THE SPINAL CORD: CONDUCTOR PATHWAYExtending downward from the brain through the vertebrae, to the level ofapproximately the second lumbar vertebra, is the spinal cord, a two-wayconductor pathway between the brainstem and the peripheral nervous system.The spinal cord is also the reflex center for activities that don t require braincontrol, such as deep tendon reflexes, the jerking reaction elicited by tappingwith a reflex hammer.A cross section of the spinal cord shows an intemal H-shaped mass ofgray matter divided into homs, which consist primarily of neuron cellbodies. (See Cross section of the spinal cord, page 149.) Cell bodies in theposterior, or dorsal, hom primarily relay sensations; those in the anterior, orventral, hom are needed for voluntary or reflex motor activity. The whitematter surrounding the outer part of these homs consists of myelinated nervefibers grouped functionally in vertical columns, called tracts. The sensory,or ascending, tracts carry sensory impulses up the spinal cord to the brain;the motor, or descending, tracts carry motor impulses down the spinal cord.The brain s motor impulses reach a descending tract and continue through theperipheral nervous system via upper motor neurons. These neurons originatein the brain and form two major systems:Cross Section of the Spinal Cord",12,99
335,"The cross section of the spinal cord below shows the anterior andposterior segments.Sensory neuron Posterior. dendrite root Gray matter) se ;Posterior root ganglion Posterior hom Fromsensoryreceptor To muscleor glandeffector Spinalnerve Anterior hom Motor White matter neuron Anterior root root The pyramidal system (corticospinal tract) is responsible for fine, skilledmovements of skeletal muscle. An impulse in this system originates in thefrontal lobe s motor cortex and travels downward to the pyramids of themedulla, where it crosses to the opposite side of the spinal cord. The extrapyramidal system (extracorticospinal tract) controls grossmotor movements. An impulse traveling in this system originates in thefrontal lobe s motor cortex and is mediated by basal ganglia, the thalamus,cerebellum, and reticular formation before descending to the spinal cord.OUTLYING AREASMessages transmitted through the spinal cord reach outlying areas through theperipheral nervous system, which originates in 31 pairs of segmentallyarranged spinal nerves attached to the spinal cord. Spinal nerves arenumbered according to their point of origin in the cord:8 cervical: Cl to C8",6,53
336,"12 thoracic: Tl to T125 lumbar: L1 to LS5 sacral: SI to S5 1 coccygeal.On the cross section of the spinal cord, you ll see that these spinal nervesare attached to the spinal cord by two roots: The anterior, or ventral, root consists of motor fibers that relay impulsesfrom the cord to glands and muscles. The posterior, or dorsal, root consists of sensory fibers that relay sensoryinformation from receptors to the cord. The posterior root has an enlargedarea the posterior root ganglion which is made up of sensory neuroncell bodies.After leaving the vertebral column, each spinal nerve separates into rami(branches), distributed peripherally, with extensive but organizedoverlapping. This overlapping reduces the chance of lost sensory or motorfunction from interruption of a single spinal nerve.TWO FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS The somatic (voluntary) nervous system is activated by will but can alsofunction independently. It s responsible for all conscious and highermental processes and for subconscious and reflex actions such asshivering.The autonomic (involuntary) nervous system regulates unconsciousprocesses to control involuntary body functions, such as digestion,respiration, and cardiovascular function. It s usually divided into twocompeting systems: The sympathetic nervous system controls energyexpenditure, especially in stressful situations, by releasing adrenergiccatecholamines. The parasympathetic nervous system helps conserveenergy by releasing the cholinergic neurohormone acetylcholine. Thesesystems balance each other to support homeostasis under normalconditions. ASSESSING NEUROLOGIC FUNCTIONA complete neurologic assessment helps confirm the diagnosis when aneurologic disorder is suspected. It establishes a clinical baseline and can",10,85
337,"offer lifesaving clues to rapid deterioration. Neurologic assessment includes: Patient history: In addition to the usual information, try to elicit thepatient s and the family s perception of the disorder. Use the patientinterview to make observations that help evaluate mental status andbehavior. Physical examination: Pay particular attention to obvious abnormalitiesthat may signal serious neurologic problems; for example, fluid drainingfrom the nose or ears. Check for these significant symptoms: headaches, especially if they re more severe in the moming, wake thepatient, or the pain is unusually intense change in visual acuity, especially sudden changenumbness or tingling in one or more extremities clumsiness or complete loss of function in an extremitymood swings or personality changes any new onset of seizures or change in seizure activity.Neurologic examination: Determine cerebral, cerebellar, motor, sensory,and cranial nerve function.Obviously, there isn t always time for a complete neurologic examinationduring bedside assessment. It s therefore necessary to select priorities; forexample, typical bedside assessment focuses on level of consciousness(LOC), pupillary response, motor function, reflexes, sensory functions, andvital signs. However, when time permits, a complete neurologic examinationcan provide valuable information regarding total neurologic function.ASSESSING MENTAL STATUS, INTELLECT, AND BEHAVIORMental status and behavior are good indicators of cerebral function, andthey re easy to assess. Note the patient s appearance, mannerisms, posture,facial expression, grooming, and tone of voice. Check for orientation to time,place, and person and for memory of recent and past events. To test intellect,ask the patient to count backward from 100 by 7s, to read aloud, or tointerpret a common proverb, and see how well they understand and followcommands. To assess executive function, ask the patient to follow a series ofcommands. If you make such checks frequently, vary the questions to avoid aprogrammed response.",12,93
338,"ASSESSING LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESSLOC is a valuable indicator of neurologic function. It can vary from alertness(response to verbal stimulus) to coma (failure to respond even to painfulstimulus). Document the patient s exact response to the stimulus; for example,write, Patient pulled away in response to nail bed pressure, rather than asimple adjective like stuporous. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which assesses eye opening as well asverbal and motor responses, provides a quick, standardized account ofneurologic status. In this test, each response receives a numerical value. (See Glasgow Coma Scale, page 151.) For instance, if the patient readilyresponds verbally and is oriented to time, place, and person, scores a 5; ifcompletely unable to respond verbally, scores a 1. If the patient is intubatedor has a tracheostomy, assess and score accordingly, such as 5/T ( T meaning tracheostomy). A score of 15 for all three parts is normal; 7 or lessindicates coma; 3 the lowest score possible generally (but not always)indicates brain death. Although the GCS is useful, it isn t a substitute for acomplete neurologic assessment.Glasgow Coma Scale To quickly assess a patient s level of consciousness and to uncoverbaseline changes, use the Glasgow Coma Scale. This assessment toolgrades consciousness in relation to eye opening and motor and verbalresponses. A decreased reaction score in one or more categories wamsof an impending neurologic crisis. A patient scoring 7 or less is comatoseand probably has severe neurologic damage. wn O 8o OTest Patient s reaction Best eye opening response Open spontaneously Open to verbal command Open to pain No response Best motor response Obeys verbal command Localizes painful stimuli Flexion-withdrawal Flexion-abnormal (decorticate rigidity)Extension (decerebrate rigidity)No response FSPNWAHOAD ANWH",14,85

Ask the patient to touch the nose with each index finger, altemating hands.Repeat this test with the eyes closed. Instruct the patient to tap the index finger and thumb of each hand togetherrapidly. Have the patient draw a figure eight in the air with one foot. To test tandem walk, ask the patient to walk heel to toe in a straight line. To test balance, perform the Romberg test: Ask the patient to stand withfeet together, eyes closed, and arms outstretched without losing balance.Motor function is a good indicator of LOC and can also point to central orperipheral nervous system damage. During all tests of motor function, watchfor differences between right and left side functions. To check gait, ask the patient to walk while you observe posture, balance,and coordination of leg movement and arm swing. To check muscle tone, palpate muscles at rest and in response to passiveflexion. Look for flaccidity, spasticity, and rigidity. Measure muscle size,and look for involuntary movements, such as rapid jerks, tremors, orcontractions. To evaluate muscle strength, have the patient grip your hands and squeeze.Then ask the patient to push against your palm with a foot. Comparemuscle strength on each side, using a 5-point scale (5 is normal strength, 0is complete paralysis). Insert table of motor strength; also test the patient sability to extend and flex the neck, elbows, wrists, fingers, toes, hips, andknees; to extend the spine; to contract and relax the abdominal muscles;and to rotate the shoulders.",14,101
340,"Rate reflexes on a 4-point scale (4 is clonus, 2 1s normal, 0 is absentreflex). Before testing reflexes, make sure that the patient is comfortableand relaxed. To test deep reflexes, use a reflex hammer to briskly tap thebiceps, the triceps, and the brachioradialis, patellar, and Achilles tendonregions. A normal response is rapid extension and contraction. Then, totest superficial reflexes, stroke the skin of the abdominal, gluteal, plantar,and scrotal regions with a moderately sharp object that won t puncture theskin. For the superficial reflexes, abdominal gluteal and scrotalcontraction should move toward the stimulus. The plantar reflex toesshould curl down.ASSESSING SENSORY FUNCTIONImpaired or absent sensation in the trunk or extremities can point to brain,spinal cord, or peripheral nerve damage. Determining the extent of sensorydysfunction is important because it helps locate neurologic damage. Forinstance, localized dysfunction indicates local peripheral nerve damage,dysfunction over a single dermatome (an area served by of the 31 pairs ofspinal nerves) indicates damage to the nerve s dorsal root, and dysfunctionextending over more than one dermatome suggests brain or spinal corddamage.In assessing sensory function, always test both sides of symmetrical areas for instance, both arms, not just one. Reassure the patient that the testwon t be painful. Superficial pain perception: Lightly press the point of an open safety pinagainst the patient s skin. Don t press hard enough to scratch the skin.Discard pin after use. Thermal sensitivity: The patient tells what it feels like when you place atest tube filled with hot water and one filled with cold water against theskin. Tactile sensitivity: Ask the patient to close the eyes and tell you what isfelt when touched lightly on hands, wrists, arms, thighs, lower legs, feet,and trunk with a wisp of cotton. Sensitivity to vibration: Place the base of a vibrating tuning fork againstthe patient s wrists, elbows, knees, or other bony prominences. Hold it inplace, and ask the patient to tell you when it stops vibrating.",16,102
341,"Position sense: Hold the lateral medial portion of the patient s fingersand toes and move them up, down, and to the side. Ask the patient to tellyou the direction of movement. Discriminatory sensation: Ask the patient to close the eyes and identifyfamiliar textures (velvet or burlap) or objects placed in the hand omumbers and letters traced on the palm. Two-point discrimination: Using calipers or other sharp objects, touchthe patient in two different places simultaneously. Ask if the patient canfeel one or two points. Record how many millimeters of separation arerequired for the patient to feel two points.ASSESSING CRANIAL NERVE FUNCTIONBy using the simple tests that follow, you can reliably localize cranial nervedysfunction. Olfactory nerve (I): Have the patient close both eyes and, using eachnostril separately, try to identify common nonirritating smells, such ascinnamon, coffee, or peppermint. Optic nerve (II): Examine the patient s eyes with an ophthalmoscope, andhave them read a Snellen eye chart or a newspaper. To test peripheralvision, ask the patient to cover one eye and fix the other eye on a pointdirectly in front of him. Then, ask if the patient can see you wiggle yourfinger in the four quadrants; you d expect them to see your finger in allfour. Oculomotor nerve (III): Compare the size and shape of the patient spupils and the equality of pupillary response to a small light in a darkenedroom. Shine the light from a lateral position, not directly in front of thepatient s eyes. Trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI): To assess for conjugateand lateral eye movement, ask the patient to follow your finger with botheyes as you slowly move it from the far left to the far right. Trigeminal nerve (V): To test all three portions of this cranial nerve, testfacial sensation by stroking the patient s jaws, cheeks, and forehead witha cotton swab, the point of a pin, or test tubes filled with hot or coldwater. Because testing for a blink reflex is irritating to the patient, it s notcommonly done. If you must test for this response (it may be decreased inpatients who wear contact lenses), touch the comea lightly with a wisp of",16,103
342,"cotton or tissue, and avoid repeating the test, if possible. To test for jawjerk, ask the patient to hold their mouth slightly open; then tap the middleof their chin lightly with a reflex hammer. The jaw should jerk closed. Facial nerve (VII): To test upper and lower facial motor function, ask thepatient to raise the eyebrows, close the eyes, wrinkle the forehead, andshow the teeth. To test sense of taste, ask the patient to identify the taste ofsalty, sour, sweet, and bitter substances, which you have placed on theirtongue. Acoustic nerve (VIII): Ask the patient to identify common sounds such asa ticking clock. With a tuning fork, test for air and bone conduction. Glossopharyngeal nerve (IX): To test gag reflex, touch a tongue blade toeach side of the patient s pharynx.Vagus nerve (X): Observe ability to swallow, and watch for symmetricalmovements of soft palate when the patient says, Ah. Spinal accessory nerve (XI): To test shoulder muscle strength, palpate thepatient s shoulders, and ask the patient to shrug against a resistance. Hypoglossal nerve (XII): To test tongue movement, ask the patient to stickout his or her tongue. Inspect it for tremor, atrophy, or lateral deviation.To test for strength, ask the patient to move his or her tongue from side toside while you hold a tongue blade against it.TESTING FOR A FIRM DIAGNOSISA firm diagnosis of many neurologic disorders usually requires a wide rangeof diagnostic tests both noninvasive and invasive. Noninvasive tests aredone first and may include the following: Skull X-ray identifies skull malformations, fractures, erosion, orthickening. Changes in landmarks may indicate a space-occupying lesion. Computed tomography (CT) scan produces three-dimensional images thatcan identify hemorrhage, intracranial tumors, malformation, and cerebralatrophy, edema, calcification, and infarction. If a contrast medium is used,the procedure is invasive. CT angiography uses CT technology withcontrast media to produce images of the intracranial vessels to identifyaneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) views the CNS in greater detail than a CT scan and is the procedure of choice for detecting multiple sclerosis(MS); intraluminal clots, brainstem, posterior fossa, and spinal cord",16,123
343,"lesions; early cerebral infarction; and brain tumors. A noniodinatedcontrast medium may be used to enhance lesions. MR angiography uses MR technique with contrast media to evaluate the cerebral vessels. MRspectroscopy provides a measure of brain chemistry. It can be used tomonitor biochemical changes in tumors, epilepsy, metabolic disorders,infection, and neurodegenerative diseases. EEG detects abnormal electrical activity in the brain (e.g., from a seizure,metabolic disorder, or drug overdose). Ultrasonography detects carotid lesions or changes in carotid blood flowand velocity. High frequency sound waves reflect back the velocity ofblood flow, which is then reported as a graphic recording of a waveform. Transcranial Doppler sonography uses ultrasound high frequency soundwaves to measure the rate and direction of blood flow in the intracranialvessels.Evoked potentials evaluate the visual, auditory, and somatosensory nervepathways by measuring the brain s electrical response to stimulation ofthe sensory organs or peripheral nerves.Invasive tests may include the following: In lumbar puncture, a needle is inserted into the subarachnoid space of thespinal cord, usually between L3 and L4 (or L4 and LS). This allowsaspiration of CSF for analysis to detect infection or hemorrhage; todetermine cell count and glucose, protein, and globulin levels; and tomeasure CSF pressure. Lumbar puncture is usually contraindicated inhydrocephalus and in increased intracranial pressure (ICP) because aquick pressure reduction may cause brain hemiation. (See What happensin increased ICP, page 154.)PATHOPHYSIOLOGYWHAT HAPPENS IN INCREASED ICPIntracranial pressure (ICP) is the pressure exerted within the intactskull by the intracranial volume about 10 blood, 10 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and 80 brain tissue water. The rigid skullallows very little space for expansion of these substances. When ICPincreases to pathologic levels, brain damage can result.",15,107
344,"The brain compensates for increases in ICP by regulating thevolumes of the three substances in the following ways: limiting blood flow to the head displacing CSF into the spinal canal increasing absorption or decreasing production of CSF withdrawing water from brain tissue into the blood and excreting itthrough the kidneys. When compensatory mechanisms becomeoverworked, small changes in volume lead to large changes inpressure.The chart at right will help you understand the pathophysiology ofincreased ICP.",2,30
345,"Brain insult Trauma (contusion, laceration, intracranial hemorrhage)Cerebral edema (following surgery, stroke, infection,hypoxia)Hydrocephalus Space-occupying lesion (tumor, abscess)Slight increase in intracranial pressure (ICP)Attempt at normal regulation of ICP by decreased bloodflow to head Slight decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) Loss of autoregulatory mechanism of constrictionor dilation of cerebral blood vessels if increased ICP persists Uncal or centralhemiation Further decrease in CPP",1,31
346,"Brain death Myelography follows a lumbar puncture and CSF removal. In thisprocedure, a radiologic dye is instilled and X-rays show spinalabnormalities and determine spinal cord and or nerve root compressionrelated to back pain or extremity weakness. Incerebral arteriography, also known as angiography, a catheter isinserted into an artery usually the femoral artery and is threaded up tothe carotid artery. Then a radiopaque dye is injected, allowing X-rayvisualization of the cerebral vasculature. Sometimes the catheter isthreaded directly into the brachial or carotid artery. This test can showcerebrovascular abnormalities and spasms plus arterial changes due to atumor, arteriosclerosis, hemorrhage, an aneurysm, or blockage. A patientundergoing this procedure is at risk for a stroke and for increased ICP. Brain scan measures gamma rays produced by a radioisotope injected IV.Uptake and distribution of the isotope in the brain highlights intracranialmasses, vascular lesions, and other problems. ICP monitoring can be a direct, invasive method of identifying trends in ICP. A subarachnoid screw or an intraventricular catheter converts CSFpressure readings into waveforms that are displayed digitally on anoscilloscope monitor. Another method uses a fiber-optic catheter insertedin the subdural space or the brain parenchyma; with this indirect method,pressure changes are reported digitally or in waveform. Electromyography detects lower motor neuron disorders, neuromusculardisorders, and nerve damage. A needle inserted into selected muscles atrest and during voluntary contraction picks up nerve impulses andmeasures nerve conduction time.Congenital Anomalies CEREBRAL PALSYThe most common cause of crippling in children, cerebral palsy (CP) is agroup of neuromuscular disorders resulting from prenatal, perinatal, orpostnatal CNS damage. Although nonprogressive, these disorders may",14,103
347,"become more obvious as an affected infant grows older. Three major types of CP occur spastic, athetoid, and ataxic sometimes in mixed forms. Motorimpairment may be minimal (sometimes apparent only during physicalactivities such as running) or severely disabling. Associated defects, such asseizures, speech disorders, and mental retardation, are common. Theprognosis varies; in cases of mild impairment, proper treatment may make anear-normal life possible.Causes and Incidence See Causes of cerebral palsy for a more detailed description of the causesof CP. Incidence is slightly higher in premature neonates (anoxia plays thegreatest role in contributing to CP) and in neonates who are small for theirgestational age. CP is slightly more common in males than in females. Forevery 1,000 births, 2 to 4 neonates are affected.Spastic CP is the most common type of CP, affecting about 50 of CPpatients. Athetoid CP affects about 20 of CP patients, ataxic CP accountsfor another 10 of these patients, and the remaining 20 of patients aremixed, with a combination of symptoms.Pathophysiology During the early stages of brain development, a structural abnormality occurswhich results in impaired motor function or a cognitive deficit. The defectsare present at birth but because of relative immaturity of the CNS at birth theneurologic deficits become apparent later on.Complications Seizure disorder Injuries from falls Speech, vision, and hearing problems Language and perception deficits Respiratory problems (poor swallowing and gag reflexes) Dental problems Mental retardation Signs and Symptoms",10,89
348,"Spastic CP is characterized by hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, increasedstretch reflexes, rapid altemating muscle contraction and relaxation, muscleweakness, underdevelopment of affected limbs, muscle contraction inresponse to manipulation, and a tendency to contractures. Typically, a childwith spastic CP walks on his or her toes with a scissors gait, crossing onefoot in front of the other.In athetoid CP, involuntary movements grimacing, wormlike writhing,dystonia, and sharp jerks impair voluntary movement. Usually, theseinvoluntary movements affect the arms more severely than the legs;involuntary facial movements may make speech difficult. These athetoidmovements become more severe during stress, decrease with relaxation, anddisappear entirely during sleep.Ataxic CP is characterized by disturbed balance, incoordination(especially of the arms), hypoactive reflexes, nystagmus, muscle weakness,tremor, lack of leg movement during infancy, and a wide-based gait as thechild begins to walk. Ataxia makes sudden or fine movements almostimpossible.Causes of Cerebral Palsy Cerebral palsy (CP) is caused by a developmental brain malformation omeurologic damage. Prenatal conditions that may increase risk of CP: matemal infection(especially rubella), matemal drug ingestion, radiation, anoxia,toxemia, matemal diabetes, abnormal placental attachment,malnutrition, and isoimmunization Perinatal and birth difficulties that increase the risk of CP: forcepsdelivery, breech presentation, placenta previa, abruptio placentae,metabolic or electrolyte disturbances, abnormal matemal vital signsfrom general or spinal anesthetic, prolapsed cord with delay indelivery of head, premature birth, prolonged or unusually rapid labor,and multiple birth (especially infants bom last in a multiple birth) Infection or trauma during infancy: poisoning, severe kemicterusresulting from erythroblastosis fetalis, brain infection, head trauma,prolonged anoxia, brain tumor, cerebral circulatory anomalies causing",6,120
349,"blood vessel rupture, and systemic disease resulting in cerebralthrombosis or embolus Some children with CP display a combination of these clinical features. Inmost, impaired motor function makes eating (especially swallowing) difficultand retards growth and development. Up to 40 of these children arementally retarded, about 25 have seizure disorders, and about 80 haveimpaired speech. Many also have dental abnormalities, vision and hearingdefects, and reading disabilities.Diagnosis Early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and requires preciseneurologic assessment and careful clinical observation during infancy. CTscan and MRI can reveal structural or congenital abnormalities. Suspect CPwhenever an infant: has difficulty sucking or keeping the nipple or food in his or her mouth seldom moves voluntarily or has arm or leg tremors with voluntarymovement crosses legs when lifted from behind rather than pulling them up or bicycling like a normal infanthas legs that are difficult to separate, making diaper changing difficult persistently uses only one hand or, as they get older, uses hands well butnot legs.Infants at particular risk include those with low birth weight, low Apgarscores at 5 minutes, seizures, and metabolic disturbances. However, allinfants should have a screening test for CP as a regular part of their 6-monthcheckup.Treatment CP can t be cured, but proper treatment can help affected children reach theirfull potential within the limitations set by this disorder. Such treatmentrequires a comprehensive and cooperative effort involving physicians,nurses, teachers, psychologists, the child s family, and occupational,physical, and speech therapists. Home care is usually possible. Treatmentusually includes interventions that encourage optimum development:",10,92
350,"Braces or splints and special appliances, such as adapted eating utensilsand a low toilet seat with arms, help these children perform activitiesindependently. Anartificial urinary sphincter may be indicated for the incontinent childwho can use the hand controls. Range-of-motion stretches minimize contractures.Orthopedic surgery may be indicated to correct contractures. Botulinumtoxin has been shown to reduce or delay the need for surgery. Phenytoin, phenobarbital, or another anticonvulsant may be used tocontrol seizures.Muscle relaxants or neurosurgery may be required to decrease spasticity.Children with milder forms of CP should attend a regular school; severelyafflicted children may need special education.Special Considerations A child with CP may be hospitalized for orthopedic surgery or fortreatment of other complications. Speak slowly and distinctly. Encourage the child to ask for things he orshe wants. Listen patiently and don t rush. Plana high-calorie diet that s adequate to meet the child s high-energyneeds. During meals, maintain a quiet, unhurried atmosphere with as fewdistractions as possible. The child should be encouraged to feed himselfand may need special utensils and a chair with a solid footrest. Teach thepatient to place food far back in his or her mouth to facilitate swallowing. Encourage the child to chew food thoroughly, drink through a straw, andsuck on lollipops to develop the muscle control needed to minimizedrooling. Allow the child to wash and dress independently, assisting only asneeded. The child may need clothing modifications. Give all care in an unhurried manner; otherwise, muscle spasticity mayincrease. Encourage the child and their family to participate in the plan of care sothey can continue it at home. Care for associated hearing or visual disturbances, as necessary. Give frequent mouth care and dental care, as necessary.",19,88
351,"Reduce muscle spasms that increase postoperative pain by moving andtuming the child carefully after surgery; provide analgesics as needed. After orthopedic surgery, provide cast care. Reposition the child often,check for foul odor, and ventilate under the cast with a cool air blow-dryer. Use a flashlight to check for skin breakdown beneath the cast. Helpthe child relax, perhaps by giving a warm bath, before reapplying abivalved cast.To help the parents: Encourage them to set realistic individual goals. Assist in planning crafts and other activities. Stress the child s need to develop peer relationships; wam the parentsagainst being overprotective. Identify and deal with family stress. The parents may feel unreasonableguilt about their child s handicap and may need psychological counseling. Refer the parents to supportive community organizations. For moreinformation, tell them to contact the United Cerebral Palsy Association ortheir local chapter.HYDROCEPHALUSHydrocephalus is an excessive accumulation of CSF within the ventricularspaces of the brain. The resulting compression can damage brain tissue. Withearly detection and surgical intervention, the prognosis improves but remainsguarded. Even after surgery, such complications as mental retardation,impaired motor function, and vision loss can persist. Without surgery, theprognosis is poor: Mortality may result from increased ICP; infants may alsodie prematurely of infection and malnutrition.Causes and Incidence Hydrocephalus may result from an_ obstruction in CSF flow(noncommunicating hydrocephalus) or from faulty absorption of CSF(communicating hydrocephalus). (See Normal circulation of CSF.)Normal Circulation of CSF",17,90
352,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced from blood ina capillary network(choroid plexus) in the brain s lateral ventricles. From the lateralventricles, CSF flows through the interventricular foramen (foramen of Monro) to the third ventricle. From there, it flows through the aqueduct of Sylvius to the fourth ventricle and through the foramina of Luschka and Magendie to the cistema of the subarachnoid space.Then, the fluid passes under the base of the brain, upward over thebrain s upper surfaces, and down around the spinal cord. Eventually,CSF reaches the arachnoid villi, where it s reabsorbed into venous bloodat the venous sinuses.Normally, the amount of fluid produced (about 500 m L/day) equals theamount absorbed. The average amount circulated at one time is 150 to175 m L.Central sulcus Lateralventricle Choroid3rd ventricle plexus) 4 Superior Cistem of great : .

353,"Mental retardation Impaired motor function Vision loss Death Pathophysiology In noncommunicating hydrocephalus, the obstruction occurs most frequentlybetween the third and fourth ventricles, at the aqueduct of Sylvius, but it canalso occur at the outlets of the fourth ventricle (foramina of Luschka and Magendie) or, rarely, at the foramen of Monro. This obstruction may resultfrom faulty fetal development, infection (syphilis, granulomatous diseases,meningitis), a tumor, cerebral aneurysm, or a blood clot (after intracranialhemorrhage). In communicating hydrocephalus, faulty absorption of CSF mayresult from surgery to repair a myelomeningocele, adhesions betweenmeninges at the base of the brain, or meningeal hemorrhage. Rarely, a tumorin the choroid plexus causes overproduction of CSF, producinghydrocephalus.Complications Mental retardation Impaired motor function Vision loss Death Signs and Symptoms In infants, the unmistakable sign of hydrocephalus is rapidly increasing headcircumference, clearly disproportionate to the infant s growth. Othercharacteristic changes include widening and bulging of the fontanels;distended scalp veins; thin, shiny, and fragile-looking scalp skin; andunderdeveloped neck muscles. In severe hydrocephalus, the roof of the orbitis depressed, the eyes are displaced downward, and the sclerae areprominent. Sclera seen above the iris is called the setting-sun sign. A high-pitched, shrill cry; abnormal muscle tone of the legs; irritability; anorexia;and projectile vomiting commonly occur. In adults and older children,indicators of hydrocephalus include decreased LOC, ataxia, incontinence,loss of coordination, and impaired intellect.",9,91
354,"Diagnosis In infants, abnormally large head size for the patient s age strongly suggestshydrocephalus. Measurement of head circumference is a most importantdiagnostic technique. Skull X-rays show thinning of the skull with separationof sutures and widening of fontanels.Other diagnostic tests for hydrocephalus, including arteriography, CT scan,and MRI, can differentiate between hydrocephalus and intracranial lesionsand can also demonstrate the Amold Chiari deformity, which may occur inan infant with hydrocephalus. (See Amold Chiari syndrome, page 158.)Amold Chiari Syndrome Amold Chiari syndrome frequently accompanies hydrocephalus,especially when a myelomeningocele is also present. In this condition, anelongation or tonguelike downward projection of the cerebellum andmedulla extends through the foramen magnum into the cervical portion ofthe spinal canal, impairing cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the fourthventricle.In addition to signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus, infants with Amold Chiari syndrome have nuchal rigidity, noisy respirations,irritability, vomiting, weak sucking reflex, and a preference forhyperextension of the neck.Treatment requires surgery to insert a shunt like that used inhydrocephalus. Surgical decompression of the cerebellar tonsils at theforamen magnum is sometimes indicated.Treatment Surgical correction is the only treatment for hydrocephalus. Surgery typicallyconsists of insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which transports excessfluid from the lateral ventricle into the peritoneal cavity. A less commonprocedure is insertion of a ventriculoatrial shunt, which drains fluid from thebrain s lateral ventricle into the right atrium of the heart, where the fluidmakes its way into the venous circulation.Another procedure that can be done for noncommunicating hydrocephalusis an endoscopic third ventriculostomy. This involves inserting an endoscope",10,96
355,"into the third ventricle and fenestrating the floor of the ventricle to allow CSF to flow out.Complications of surgery include shunt infection, septicemia (afterventriculoatrial shunt), adhesions and paralytic ileus, migration, peritonitis,and intestinal perforation (with peritoneal shunt) or failure of the thirdventriculostomy and retum of hydrocephalus.Special Considerations On initial assessment, obtain a complete history from the patient or theirfamily. Note general behavior, especially irritability, apathy, or decreased LOC. Performa neurologic assessment. Examine the eyes: pupils shouldbe equal and reactive to light. In adults and older children, evaluatemovements and motor strength in extremities. Watch especially for ataxia,confusion, and incontinence. Ask if the patient has headaches, and watchfor projectile vomiting; both are signs of increased ICP. Also watch forseizures. Note changes in vital signs.Before surgery to insert a shunt: Encourage matemal infant bonding when possible. When caring for theinfant yourself, hold on your lap for feeding; stroke and cuddle him, andspeak soothingly.Check fontanels for tension or fullness, and measure and record headcircumference. On the patient s chart, draw a picture showing where tomeasure the head so that other staff members measure it in the same place,or mark the forehead with ink. To prevent post feeding aspiration and hypostatic pneumonia, place theinfant on his or her side and reposition every 2 hours, or prop up in aninfant seat. To prevent skin breakdown, make sure the infant s earlobe is flat, andplace a sheepskin or rubber foam under the infant s head. When tuming the infant, move the head, neck, and shoulders with the bodyto reduce strain on the neck. Feed the infant slowly. To lessen strain from the weight of the infant shead on your arm while holding during feeding, place head, neck, andshoulders on a pillow.After surgery:",16,116
356,"Place the infant on the side opposite the operative site with the head levelwith the body unless the physician s orders specify otherwise.Check temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, and LOC. Also checkfontanels for fullness daily. Watch for vomiting, which may be an earlysign of increased ICP and shunt malfunction. Watch for signs of infection, especially meningitis: fever, stiff neck,irritability, or tense fontanels. Also watch for redness, swelling, or othersigns of local infection over the shunt tract. Check dressing often fordrainage. Listen for bowel sounds after ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Check the infant s growth and development periodically, and help theparents set goals consistent with ability and potential. Help parents focuson their child s strengths, not their weaknesses. Discuss special educationprograms, and emphasize the infant s need for sensory stimulationappropriate for age. Teach parents to watch for signs of shunt malfunction,infection, and paralytic ileus. Tell them that surgery for lengthening theshunt will be required periodically as the child grows older. Surgery mayalso be required to correct shunt malfunctioning or to treat infection.Emphasize that hydrocephalus is a lifelong problem and that the child willrequire regular, continuing evaluation.CEREBRAL ANEURYSMCerebral aneurysm is a localized dilation of a cerebral artery that typicallyresults from a congenital weakness in the arterial wall. Its most commonform is the berry aneurysm, a saclike outpouching in a cerebral artery.Cerebral aneurysms may arise at an arterial junction in the circle of Willis,the circular anastomosis forming the major cerebral arteries at the base of thebrain. Cerebral aneurysms can rupture and cause subarachnoid hemorrhage.(See How a cerebral aneurysm forms, page 160.)PATHOPHYSIOLOGYHOW A CEREBRAL ANEURYSM FORMSIn an intracranial or cerebral aneurysm, a weakness in the wall of thecerebral artery causes localized dilation. Cerebral aneurysms usuallyarise at an arterial junction in the circle of Willis, the circular",18,103
357,"anastomosis comnecting the major cerebral arteries at the base of thebrain. Many cerebral aneurysms rupture, causing a subarachnoidhemorrhage.Anteriorcerebralartery Anteriorcommunicating Middle arterycerebralartery Aneurysm Posteriorcommunicating artery Posteriorcerebralartery Basilar artery The prognosis is guarded. About 40 of the patients with subarachnoidhemorrhages die immediately; of those who survive untreated, 35 die fromthe effects of hemorrhage; another 15 die later from recurring hemorrhage.Sixty percent of patients who recover are left with neurologic deficit.Advances in imaging and interventional procedures are improving theoutcome overall.Causes and Incidence Cerebral aneurysm may result from a congenital defect, a degenerativeprocess, or a combination. For example, hypertension and atherosclerosis",4,38
358,"may disrupt blood flow and exert pressure against a congenitally weakarterial wall, stretching it like an overblown balloon and making it likely torupture. After such rupture, blood spills into the space normally occupied by CSF, resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Blood may also spill into thebrain tissue and form a clot, which can result in potentially fatal increased ICP and brain tissue damage.Incidence is slightly higher in women than in men, especially those in theirlate 40s or early to mid-50s, but cerebral aneurysm may occur at any age, inboth women and men.Pathophysiology The pressure of arterial blood flow against a weak congenital vesselabnormality stretches the vessel walls the walls also become thin from thepressure making rupture likely. When the aneurysm ruptures, it spills bloodinto the subarachnoid space, which is normally occupied by the cerebralspinal fluid. Depending on the location of the aneurysm in the cerebralcirculation, blood can also be forced into the ventricular system and/or thebrain parenchyma.Complications(Most common after a rupture) Subarachnoid hemorrhage Brain tissue infarction Rebleeding Meningeal irritation Hydrocephalus Signs and Symptoms Occasionally, rupture of a cerebral aneurysm causes premonitory symptomsthat last several days, such as headache, nuchal rigidity, stiff back and legs,and intermittent nausea. Usually, however, onset is abrupt and withoutwaming, causing a sudden severe headache, nausea, vomiting and, dependingon the severity and location of bleeding, altered consciousness (includingdeep coma).Bleeding causes meningeal irritation, resulting in nuchal rigidity, back andleg pain, fever, restlessness, irritability, occasional seizures, and blurred",6,87
359,"vision. Bleeding into the brain tissues causes hemiparesis, hemisensorydefects, dysphagia, and visual defects. If the aneurysm is near the intemalcarotid artery, it compresses the oculomotor nerve and causes diplopia,ptosis, dilated pupil, and inability to rotate the eye.The severity of symptoms varies considerably from patient to patient,depending on the site and amount of bleeding. To better describe theirconditions, patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms are grouped asfollows: Grade I (minimal bleed): Patient is alert with no neurologic deficit; he orshe may have a slight headache and nuchal rigidity. Grade II (mild bleed): Patient is alert, with a mild to severe headache,nuchal rigidity and, possibly, third-nerve palsy. Grade III (moderate bleed): Patient is confused or drowsy, with nuchalrigidity and, possibly, a mild focal deficit. Grade IV (severe bleed): Patient is stuporous, with nuchal rigidity and,possibly, mild to severe hemiparesis.Grade V (moribund; commonly fatal): If nonfatal, patient is in deep comaor decerebrate.Generally, cerebral aneurysm poses three major threats: Death from increased ICP: Increased ICP may push the brain downward,impair brainstem function, and cut off blood supply to the part of the brainthat supports vital functions. Rebleed: Generally, after the initial bleeding episode, a clot forms andseals the rupture, which reinforces the wall of the aneurysm for 7 to 10days. However, after the seventh day, fibrinolysis begins to dissolve theclot and increases the risk of rebleeding. Signs and symptoms are similarto those accompanying the initial hemorrhage. Rebleeds during the first 24hours after initial hemorrhage aren t uncommon, and they contribute tocerebral aneurysm s high mortality. Vasospasm: Why this occurs isn t clearly understood. Usually, vasospasmoccurs in blood vessels adjacent to the cerebral aneurysm, but it mayextend to major vessels of the brain, causing ischemia and altered brainfunction. Risk of vasospasm can be predicted by use of the Fisher Grading scale.",14,112
360,"Fisher Blood on CT Risk of vasospasmgradell Diffuse or vertical layer of subarachnoid blood 1 mm Low (range 0 to 25 )thick Ill Localized clot and/or vertical layer within the Low to high (range 23 subarachnoid space 1 mm thick to 96 )IV ICH or IVH with diffuse or no SAH Low to moderate (range0 to 35 )ICH, intracranial hemorrhage; IVH, intraventricular hemorrhage; SAH, subarachnoidhemorrhage Other complications of cerebral aneurysm include pulmonary embolism (apossible adverse effect of deep vein thrombosis or aneurysm treatment) andacute hydrocephalus, occurring as CSF accumulates in the cranial cavitybecause of blockage by blood or adhesions.Diagnosis Diagnosis of cerebral aneurysm is based on the patient history and aneurologic examination; CT scan, which reveals subarachnoid or ventricularblood; or MRI, which can identify a cerebral aneurysm as a flow void.Cerebral angiography remains the procedure of choice for diagnosingcerebral aneurysm. A CT angiography is less invasive. Lumbar puncture maybe used to identify blood in CSF if other studies are negative and the patienthas no signs of increased ICP. Lumbar puncture should be performed if nocontraindication is present and you strongly suspect a bleed, because imagingstudies may miss a bleed.Other baseline laboratory studies include complete blood count (CBC),urinalysis, arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, coagulation studies, serumosmolality, and electrolyte and glucose levels.Treatment Coil embolization or clipping of the aneurysm aims to reduce the risk ofbleeding, rebleeding after subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral infarction.(See Repair of cerebral aneurysm, page 162.) Both methods haveadvantages and disadvantages. Reinforcing the aneurysm with wrappingwhen the vessel is easily accessible is an altemative in specific situations.Vasospasm, which previously had been the source of morbidity and mortality",7,97
361,"associated with successful surgical intervention, has shown therapeuticpromise with transluminal balloon intraarterial nimodipine, nicardipine,verapamil, and milrinone. Newer drugs in clinical trials (fasudilhydrochloride and colforsin daropate) are still under investigation.Repair of Cerebral Aneurysm Clipping a Cerebral Aneurysm The clip, which is made of materials that won t affect metal detectors andwill not rust, is placed at the base of the aneurysm to stop the bloodsupply. The clip remains in place permanently. Coil Embolization In coil embolization, soft platinum coils are inserted into the aneurysmthrough the femoral artery. Usually five to six coils are needed to fill theaneurysm. The goal is to prevent blood flow into the aneurysm sac byfilling the aneurysm with coils and thrombus.",6,39
362,"When surgical correction is delayed or hazardous because of aneurysmallocation or fitness of the patient, treatment includes:careful control of blood pressure (Calcium antagonists are preferred.)bed rest and avoidance of head-down positionavoidance of stimulants, including caffeine and catecholaminesavoidance of platelet inhibitors such as aspirincorticosteroids (sometimes used to decrease headache that results frommeningeal irritation from the blood products but studies are notconclusive) anticonvulsants sedatives. After surgical repair, the patient s condition depends on the extent ofdamage from the initial bleed and the success of treatment for any resultingcomplications. Surgery can t improve the patient s neurologic conditionunless it removes a hematoma or reduces the compression effect.Special Considerations Anaccurate neurologic assessment, good patient care, patient and familyteaching, and psychological support can speed recovery and reducecomplications. During initial treatment after hemorrhage, establish and maintain a patentairway if the patient needs supplementary oxygen. Position the patient topromote pulmonary drainage and prevent upper airway obstruction. If he",7,58
363,"or she is intubated, administering 100 oxygen before suctioning toremove secretions will prevent hypoxia and vasodilation from carbondioxide accumulation. Suction no longer than 20 seconds to avoidincreased ICP. Give frequent nose and mouth care. Impose aneurysm precautions to minimize the risk of rebleed and to avoidincreased ICP. Such precautions include bed rest in a quiet, darkenedroom (keep the head of the bed flat or under 30 degrees, as ordered);limited visitors; avoiding strenuous physical activity and straining withbowel movements; and restricted fluid intake. Be sure to explain whythese restrictive measures are necessary.Preventive measures and good patient care can minimize othercomplications: Tum the patient often. Encourage occasional deep breathing and legmovement. Wam the patient to avoid all unnecessary physical activity.Assist with active range-of-motion exercises; if the patient is paralyzed,perform regular passive range-of-motion exercises.Monitor ABG levels, LOC, and vital signs often, and accurately measureintake and output. Avoid taking temperature rectally because vagus nervestimulation may cause cardiac arrest. Watch for these danger signals, which may indicate an enlarginganeurysm, rebleeding, intracranial clot, vasospasm, or other complication:decreased LOC, unilateral enlarged pupil, onset or worsening ofhemiparesis or motor deficit, increased blood pressure, slowed pulse,worsening of headache or sudden onset of a headache, renewed orworsened nuchal rigidity, and renewed or persistent vomiting. Intermittentsigns such as restlessness, extremity weakness, and speech alterations canalso indicate increasing ICP.Give fluids as ordered, and monitor I.V. infusions to avoid increased ICP. Ifthe patient has facial weakness, assess the gag reflex and assist duringmeals, placing food in the unaffected side of the mouth. If the patient can tswallow, insert a nasogastric tube as ordered, and give all tube feedingsslowly. Prevent skin breakdown by taping the tube so it doesn t pressagainst the nostril. If the patient can eat, provide a high-fiber diet toprevent straining at stool, which can increase ICP. Obtain an order for astool softener, such as dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, or a mild laxative,and administer as ordered. Don t force fluids. Implement a bowel",19,128
364,"program on the basis of previous habits. If the patient is receivingsteroids, check the stool for blood. With third or facial nerve palsy, administer artificial tears or ointment tothe affected eye, and tape the eye shut at night to prevent comeal damage.To minimize stress, encourage relaxation techniques. If possible, avoidusing restraints because these can cause agitation and raise ICP. Administer antihypertensives as indicated. Carefully monitor bloodpressure and immediately report any significant change, but especially arise in systolic pressure. Prevent deep vein thrombosis by applying antiembolism stockings orsequential compression sleeves. If the patient can t speak, establish a simple means of communication, oruse cards or a notepad. Try to limit conversation to topics that won tfrustrate the patient. Encourage the family to speak in a normal tone, evenif the patient doesn t seem to respond. Provide emotional support, and include the patient s family in the care asmuch as possible. Encourage family members to adopt a realistic attitude,but don t discourage hope. Before discharge, make a referral to a visiting nurse or a rehabilitationcenter when necessary.ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATIONSCerebral AVM is a disorder of the blood vessels consisting of an abnormalconnection between the arteries and the veins in the brain. It s a congenitaldisorder commonly resulting in tangled masses of thin-walled, dilated bloodvessels between arteries and veins that aren t connected by capillaries. AVMprimarily occurs in the posterior portion of the cerebral hemispheres. (See Where a cerebral AVM commonly occurs, page 164.) Adequate perfusion ofbrain tissue is prevented because of abnormal channels between the arterialand venous systems that allow mixing of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood.AVMs range in size from a few millimeters to large malformations thatextend from the cerebral cortex to the ventricles. Patients typically presentwith multiple AVMs.Where a Cerebral AVM Commonly Occurs",18,95
365,"A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a disorder of bloodvessels in which there is an abnormal connection between the arteriesand the veins. It is a congenital disorder. Cerebral AVMs commonlyoccur in the posterior portion of the cerebral hemisphere.Longitudinalcere ebral fissure Cerebral cortex(gray matter)Corpus callosum- Arteriovenousmalformation Complications of AVM include development of aneurysm and subsequentrupture, hemorrhage (intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural, depending onthe location of the AVM), and hydrocephalus.Causes and Incidence Although some AVMs occur as a result of penetrating injuries such as trauma,most are present at birth, However, symptoms typically don t occur untilbetween ages 10 and 20. Very large AVMs may short-circuit blood flowenough to cause cardiac decompensation, in which the heart can t pumpenough blood to compensate for arteriovenous shunting in the brain. Thistypically occurs in infants and young children.The vessels of an AVM are very thin and one or more arteries feed into it,causing it to appear dilated and tortuous. Typically, high-pressured arterialflow moves into the venous system through the connecting channels toincrease venous pressure, engorging and dilating the venous structures. If the AVM is large enough, the shunting can deprive the surrounding tissue of",7,62
366,"adequate blood flow. Thin-walled vessels may ooze small amounts of blood they may even rupture causing hemorrhage into the brain or subarachnoidspace.Cerebral AVMs occur in approximately 3 of 10,000 people. Although thelesion is present at birth, symptoms may occur at any time. Two thirds ofcases occur before age 40. Evidence suggests that AVMs run in families.Males and females are affected equally.Pathophysiology AVMs lack the typical structural characteristics of blood vessels. The vesselwalls are thin, can have several arteries that feed into it causing it to dilate.The arterial flow moves directly into the venous channel without the normalchannel that allows for the dissipation of pressure. This causes the venousside to dilate and it can act like a mass lesion causing pressure on the brainstructures.Complications Aneurysm and subsequent rupture Intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural hemorrhage Hydrocephalus Signs and Symptoms An AVM may be asymptomatic until complications occur; these may includerupture and a resulting sudden bleed in the brain, known as a hemorrhagicstroke. AVMs vary in size and location within the brain. Systolic bruit maybe auscultated over the carotid artery, mastoid process, or orbit onexamination.Symptoms that occur before an AVM rupture are related to smaller andslower bleeding from the abnormal vessels, which are usually fragilebecause their structure is abnormal or if the AVM is larger symptoms areassociated with mass effect on the surrounding brain.In more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage from the malformationis the first symptom. Depending on the location and the severity of the bleed,the hemorrhage can be profoundly disabling or fatal. The risk of bleedingfrom an AVM is approximately 2 to 4 per year.",11,93
367,"The first symptoms often include headache, seizure, or other suddenneurologic problems, such as vision problems, weakness, inability to move alimb or a side of the body, lack of sensation in part of the body, or abnormalsensations, such as ringing and numbness. Symptoms are the same as forstroke. The individual with an AVM may complain of chronic mild headache,a sudden and severe headache, or a localized or general headache. Theheadache may resemble migraine and vomiting may occur. Seizures mayresult from focal neurologic deficits (depending on the location of the AVM)resulting from compression and diminished perfusion. Symptoms ofintracranial (intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural) hemorrhage result.Muscle weakness and decreased sensation can occur in any part of the body.Mental status change can occur where the individual appears sleepy,stuporous, lethargic, confused, disoriented, or irritable. Additional symptomsmay include stiff neck, speech or sense of smell impairment, dysfunctionalmovement, fainting, facial paralysis, eyelid drooping, tinnitus, dizziness, anddecreased LOC.Intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhages are the most common firstsymptoms of cerebral AVM. In some cases, symptoms may also occurbecause of lack of blood flow to an area of the brain (ischemia),compression or distortion of brain tissue by large AVMs, or abnormal braindevelopment in the area of the malformation. Progressive loss of nerve cellsin the brain may occur, caused by mechanical (pressure) and ischemic (lackof blood supply) factors.Diagnosis Tests used to diagnose AVM include head CT scan, cranial MRI, and MRangiography. An EEG may be performed if symptoms include seizures, butthis test isn t diagnostic of the specific area of the lesion.Cerebral arteriogram confirms the presence of AVMs and evaluates bloodflow. Doppler ultrasonography of cerebrovascular system indicatesabnormal, turbulent blood flow.Treatment General support measures include aneurysm precautions to prevent possiblerupture. This involves placing the patient on bed rest or with limited activityand maintaining a quiet atmosphere. Analgesics may be given for headache,and sedatives may be given to help calm the patient and prevent rupture.",13,120
368,"Stool softeners may be given to prevent straining at stool, which increases ICP.Hemorrhage from an AVM is a medical emergency requiring immediatehospitalization. The goal of treatment is to prevent further complications bylimiting bleeding, controlling seizures, and controlling ICP. Surgery forcorrection may include block dissection, laser, or ligation to repair thecommunicating channels and remove the feeding vessels. In most cases this isperformed in a delayed fashion to give the patient the opportunity to recoverfrom the hemorrhage. Embolization or radiation therapy may be done beforesurgery to close the communicating channels and feeder vessels, therebyreducing blood flow to the AVM or may be done as the treatment of choice indifficult to reach malformations. Open brain surgery, endovascular treatment,and radiosurgery may be used separately or in any combination, dependingon the physician and the patient s individual situation. Surgery is dependenton the accessibility and size of the lesion and the patient s status. Open brainsurgery involves the actual removal of the malformation in the brain throughan opening made in the skull. This surgery is particularly risky because thesurgery itself may cause the AVM to bleed uncontrollably.Embolization (injecting a glue-like substance into the abnormal vessels tostop aberrant blood flow into the AVM) may be an altemative if surgery isn tfeasible because of the size or location of the lesion. Stereotacticradiosurgery may also be an altemative for patients with inoperable AVMs.It s particularly useful for small, deep lesions, which are difficult to removeby surgery.Anticonvulsant medications such as phenytoin are usually prescribed ifseizures Occur.Special Considerations Monitor vital signs and adjust medications to control hypertension. Monitor neurologic status. Monitor for seizure activity and institute seizure precautions. Maintain a quiet atmosphere and provide relaxation techniques. Discuss the importance of reporting any signs of intracranial bleedingimmediately (sudden severe headache, vision changes, decreasedmovement in extremities, and change in LOC). Refer to social service for support services if neurologic deficits haveoccurred from a ruptured AVM.",15,116
369,"Paroxysmal Disorders HEADACHEThe most common patient complaint, headache usually occurs as a symptomof an underlying disorder. Ninety percent of all headaches are vascular,muscle contraction, or a combination; 10 are due to underlying intracranial,systemic, or psychological disorders. Migraine headaches, probably the mostintensively studied, are throbbing, vascular headaches that usually begin toappear in childhood or adolescence and recur throughout adulthood.Causes and Incidence Most chronic headaches result from tension (muscle contraction), which maybe caused by emotional stress, fatigue, menstruation, or environmentalstimuli (noise, crowds, or bright lights). Other possible causes includeglaucoma; inflammation of the eyes or mucosa of the nasal or paranasalsinuses; diseases of the scalp, teeth, extracranial arteries, or extemal ormiddle ear; muscle spasms of the face, neck, or shoulders; and cervicalarthritis. In addition, headaches may be caused by vasodilators (nitrates,alcohol, and histamine), systemic disease, hypoxia, hypertension, headtrauma and tumor, intracranial bleeding, abscess, or aneurysm.The cause of migraine headache is unknown, but it s associated withconstriction and dilation of intracranial and extracranial arteries. Certainbiochemical abnormalities are thought to occur during a migraine attack.These include local leakage of a vasodilator polypeptide called neurokininthrough the dilated arteries and a decrease in the plasma level of serotonin.Headache pain may emanate from the pain-sensitive structures of the skin,scalp, muscles, arteries, and veins; cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X; orcervical nerves 1, 2, and 3. Intracranial mechanisms of headaches includetraction or displacement of arteries, venous sinuses, or venous tributaries andinflammation or direct pressure on the cranial nerves with afferent painfibers.Affecting up to 10 of Americans, headaches are more common infemales and have a strong familial incidence. Drops in estrogen level mayprecipitate migraine headaches.Pathophysiology",8,113
370,"The pathophysiology of headache varies with the type of headache migraine is thought to be the result of vascular alterations, dilation of theintracranial blood vessels which allow the leakage of neurokinin. In tensionheadaches, there is a central stimulus of the trigeminal nerve that involves ahypersensitivity of pain fibers. There is also a peripheral sensitization of themyofascial sensory nerves that contribute to the pain. Headaches associatedwith intracranial lesions such as hematomas or tumors are the result ofincreased ICP.Complications Worsening of preexisting hypertension Photophobia Emotional lability Motor weakness Signs and Symptoms Initially, migraine headaches usually produce unilateral, pulsating pain,which later becomes more generalized. They re commonly preceded by ascintillating scotoma, hemianopsia, unilateral paresthesia, or speechdisorders. The patient may experience irritability, anorexia, nausea,vomiting, and photophobia. (See Clinical features of migraine headaches,pages 166 and 167.)Clinical Features of Migraine Headaches Type Signs and symptoms Common migraine (most Prodromal symptoms (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, andprevalent) fluid imbalance) precede headache by about 1 day.Usually occurs on weekends Sensitivity to light and noise (most prominent feature)and holidays Headache pain (unilateral or bilateral, aching orthrobbing)Classic migraine Prodromal symptoms include visual disturbances,Usually occurs in compulsive such as zigzag lines and bright lights (most common),personalities and within sensory disturbances (tingling of face, lips, andfamilies hands), or motor disturbances (staggering gait).

Chronic type occurs after an episodicadolescents and middle-aged pattem is established.people Unilateral pain occurs without waming, reaching acrescendo within 5 minutes, and is described asexcruciating and deep, with attacks lasting from 30minutes to 2 hours. Associated symptoms may include tearing, reddeningof the eye, nasal stuffiness, lid ptosis, and nausea.Both muscle contraction and traction-inflammatory vascular headachesproduce a dull, persistent ache; tender spots on the head and neck; and afeeling of tightness around the head, with a characteristic hatband distribution. The pain is usually severe and unrelenting. If caused byintracranial bleeding, these headaches may result in mental changes andneurologic deficits, such as paresthesia and muscle weakness; narcotics mayfail to relieve pain in these cases. If caused by a tumor, pain is most severewhen the patient awakens.Diagnosis Diagnosis requires a history of recurrent headaches and physical examinationof the head and neck. Such examination includes percussion, auscultation forbruits, inspection for signs of infection, and palpation for defects, crepitus, ortender spots (especially after trauma). Firm diagnosis also requires acomplete neurologic examination, assessment for other systemic diseases",9,113
372,"such as hypertension and a psychosocial evaluation, when such factors aresuspected.Diagnostic tests include cervical spine and sinus X-rays, CT scan performed before lumbar puncture to rule out increased ICP or MRI. Alumbar puncture isn t done if there s evidence of increased ICP or if a braintumor is suspected because rapidly reducing pressure by removing spinalfluid can cause brain hemiation.Treatment Depending on the type of headache, analgesics ranging from aspirin tocodeine or ketorolac may provide symptomatic relief. Other measuresinclude identification and elimination of causative factors and, possibly,psychotherapy for headaches caused by emotional stress. Chronic tensionheadaches may also respond to muscle relaxants. A new preventive treatmentfor migraine has just been released. Erenumab (Aimovig) is a humanmonoclonal antibody that blocks a protein fragment CGRP that instigates andperpetuates migraine. It is the first drug of its kind to specifically targetmigraine prevention.For migraine headaches, ergotamine alone or with caffeine may be aneffective treatment. The Food and Drug Administration allows labeling ofvarious analgesic preparations that include caffeine to state that they re forthe treatment of migraine headaches. Remember that these medications can tbe taken by pregnant women because they stimulate uterine contractions.These drugs and others, such as metoclopramide or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, work best when taken early in the course of an attack. Ifnausea and vomiting make oral administration impossible, drugs may begiven as rectal suppositories.Drugs in the class of sumatriptan are considered by many clinicians to bethe drug of choice for acute migraine attacks or cluster headaches. Drugs thatcan help prevent migraine headaches include antidepressants (such asnortriptyline or fluoxetine), beta-adrenergic blockers (propranolol), andcalcium channel blockers (verapamil). Corticosteroids provide short-termrelief for some patients with cluster headaches.Special Considerations",12,98
373,"Headaches seldom require hospitalization unless caused by a seriousdisorder. If that s the case, direct your care to the underlying problem. Obtain a complete patient history: duration and location of the headache;time of day it usually begins; nature of the pain; concurrence with othersymptoms such as blurred vision; precipitating factors, such as tension,menstruation, loud noises, menopause, or alcohol; medications taken suchas oral contraceptives; or prolonged fasting. Exacerbating factors can alsobe assessed through ongoing observation of the patient s personality,habits, activities of daily living, family relationships, coping mechanisms,and relaxation activities. Using the history as a guide, help the patient avoid exacerbating factors.Advise the patient to lie down ina dark, quiet room during an attack andto place ice packs on the forehead or a cold cloth over the eyes.Instruct the patient to take the prescribed medication at the onset ofmigraine symptoms, to prevent dehydration by drinking plenty of fluidsafter nausea and vomiting subside, and to use other headache reliefmeasures. The patient with a migraine headache usually needs to be hospitalizedonly if nausea and vomiting are severe enough to induce dehydration andpossible shock. Avoid repeated use of narcotics overuse of pain medication, especiallynarcotics, can produce rebound headache.BESEEa SM PREVENTION get adequate sleep eat a well-balanced diet and drink plenty of water do upper-body stretching exercises quit smoking leam relaxation techniques such as yoga, medication, and deepbreathing avoid known causative triggers.SEIZURE DISORDERSeizure disorder, also called epilepsy, is a condition of the brain marked bya susceptibility to recurrent seizures paroxysmal events associated with",7,96
374,"abnormal electrical discharges of neurons in the brain.Causes and Incidence In about half the cases of seizure disorder, the cause is unknown. However,some possible causes of seizure disorder include: birth trauma (inadequate oxygen supply to the brain, bloodincompatibility, or hemorrhage)perinatal infectionanoxia (after respiratory or cardiac arrest)infectious diseases (meningitis, encephalitis, or brain abscess)ingestion of toxins (mercury, lead, or carbon monoxide)tumors of the braininherited disorders or degenerative disease, such as phenylketonuria ortuberous sclerosis head injury or traumametabolic disorders, such as hypoglycemia or hypoparathyroidism stroke (hemorrhage, thrombosis, or embolism). Alcohol withdrawal can cause nonepileptic seizures.Seizure disorder affects 1 to 2 of the population. However, 80 ofpatients have good seizure control if they strictly adhere to the prescribedtreatment regimen.Pathophysiology Seizures are the result of abnormal synaptic transmission, an imbalance in thebrain neurotransmitters or the development of abnormal nerve connectionsafter an injury. The result is a group of hypersensitive neurons that exhibitparoxysmal depolarization. In the tonic phase of a seizure, there is excitationof subcortical, thalamic, and brainstem areas, which results in loss ofconsciousness. The clonic phase of the seizure is the result of inhibitoryneurons in the cortex, subthalamus, and basal ganglia reacting to the corticalexcitation.During the seizure oxygen is consumed at a high rate as is glucose,cerebral blood flow increases, and lactate increases in the cerebral tissues.Complications",7,83
375,"Anoxia (during a seizure)Fall injuries Signs and Symptoms The hallmarks of seizure disorder are recurring seizures, which can beclassified as partial or generalized (some patients may be affected by morethan one type).Partial seizures arise from a localized area of the brain, causing specificsymptoms. In some patients, partial seizure activity may spread to the entirebrain, causing a generalized seizure. Partial seizures include simple partial(jacksonian) and complex partial seizures (psychomotor or temporal lobe).A simple partial motor-type seizure begins as a localized motor seizurecharacterized by a spread of abnormal activity to adjacent areas of the brain.It typically produces stiffening or jerking in one extremity, accompanied by atingling sensation in the same area. For example, it may start in the thumb andspread to the entire hand and arm. The patient seldom loses consciousness,although the seizure may progress to a generalized seizure.A simple partial sensory-type seizure involves perceptual distortion,which can include hallucinations.The symptoms of a complex partial seizure vary but usually includepurposeless behavior. The patient experiences an aura immediately beforethe seizure. An aura represents the beginning of abnormal electricaldischarges within a focal area of the brain and may include a pungent smell,gastrointestinal (GI) distress (nausea or indigestion), a rising or sinkingfeeling in the stomach, a dreamy feeling, an unusual taste, or a visualdisturbance. Overt signs of a complex partial seizure include a glassy stare,picking at one s clothes, aimless wandering, lip-smacking or chewingmotions, and unintelligible speech; these signs may last for just a fewseconds or as long as 20 minutes. Mental confusion may last several minutesafter the seizure; as a result, an observer may mistakenly suspect intoxicationwith alcohol or drugs or psychosis.Generalized seizures, as the term suggests, cause a generalized electricalabnormality within the brain and include several distinct types: Absence (petit mal) seizures occur most commonly in children, althoughthey may affect adults as well. They usually begin with a brief change in LOC, indicated by blinking or rolling of the eyes, a blank stare, and slight",10,111
376,"mouth movements. There s little or no tonic-clonic movement. The patientretains posture and continues preseizure activity without difficulty.Typically, each seizure lasts from to 10 seconds. If not properly treated,seizures can recur as often as 100 times/day. An absence seizure mayprogress to generalized tonic clonic seizures. A myoclonic (bilateral massive epileptic myoclonus) seizure ischaracterized by brief, involuntary muscular jerks of the body orextremities, which may occur ina rhythmic fashion and may precedegeneralized tonic-clonic seizures by months or years. A generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure typically begins withaloud cry, precipitated by air rushing from the lungs through the vocalcords. The patient then falls to the ground, losing consciousness. The bodystiffens (tonic phase) and then altemates between episodes of muscularspasm and relaxation (clonic phase). Tongue-biting, incontinence, laboredbreathing, apnea, and subsequent cyanosis may also occur. The seizurestops in 2 to 5 minutes, when abnormal electrical conduction of theneurons is completed. The patient then regains consciousness but issomewhat confused and may have difficulty talking. If the patient can talk,they may complain of drowsiness, fatigue, headache, muscle soreness, andarm or leg weakness. The patient may fall into deep sleep after theseizure. These seizures may start as facial seizures and spread to becomegeneralized.An akinetic seizure is characterized by a general loss of postural tone (thepatient falls in a flaccid state) and a temporary loss of consciousness. Itoccurs in young children and is sometimes called a drop attack because itcauses the child to fall.Status epilepticus is a continuous seizure state that can occur in all seizuretypes. The most life-threatening example is generalized tonic clonic statusepilepticus, a continuous generalized tonic-clonic seizure withoutintervening retum of consciousness. Status epilepticus is accompanied byrespiratory distress. It can result from abrupt withdrawal of anticonvulsantmedications, hypoxic encephalopathy, acute head trauma, metabolicencephalopathy, or septicemia secondary to encephalitis or meningitis.Diagnosis",19,104
377,"Clinically, the diagnosis of seizure disorder is based on the occurrence ofone or more seizures and proof or the assumption that the condition that ledto them is still present.Diagnostic information is obtained from the patient s history anddescription of seizure activity and from family history, physical andneurologic examinations, and CT scan or MRI. These scans offer densityreadings of the brain and may indicate abnormalities in intemal structures.Paroxysmal abnormalities on the EEG confirm the diagnosis by providingevidence of the continuing tendency to have seizures. A negative EEGdoesn t rule out seizure disorder because the paroxysmal abnormalities occurintermittently. Other tests may include serum glucose and calcium studies,skull X-rays, lumbar puncture, brain scan, and cerebral angiography.Treatment Generally, treatment of seizure disorder consists of anticonvulsant therapy toreduce the number of future seizures. The most commonly prescribed drugsinclude phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, gabapentin, primidone,levetiracetam administered individually for generalized tonic-clonicseizures and complex partial seizures. Valproic acid, clonazepam, andethosuximide are commonly prescribed for absence seizures. Gabapentin andfelbamate are also anticonvulsant drugs.A patient taking anticonvulsant medications requires monitoring for toxicsigns: nystagmus, ataxia, lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, slurred speech,irritability, nausea, and vomiting.If drug therapy fails, treatment may include surgical removal of ademonstrated focal lesion to attempt to stop seizures. Emergency treatment ofstatus epilepticus usually consists of diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam(Ativan), phenytoin or phenobarbital (Solfoton); dextrose 50 IV. (whenseizures are secondary to hypoglycemia); and thiamine IV. (in chronicalcoholism or withdrawal).Special Considerations A key to support is a true understanding of the nature of seizure disorder andof the misconceptions that surround it. Encourage the patient and family to express their feelings about thepatient s condition. Answer their questions, and help them cope by",12,107
378,"dispelling some of the myths about seizure disorder, for example, the myththat seizure disorder is contagious. Assure them that seizure disorder iscontrollable for most patients who follow a prescribed regimen ofmedication and that most patients maintain a normal lifestyle.Because drug therapy is the treatment of choice for most people withseizure disorder, information about medications is invaluable. Stress the need for compliance with the prescribed drug schedule.Reinforce dosage instructions and stress the importance of takingmedication regularly, at scheduled times. Caution the patient to monitorthe quantity of medication so it does not run out. Wam against possible adverse effects drowsiness, lethargy,hyperactivity, confusion, and visual and sleep disturbances all of whichindicate the need for dosage adjustment. Phenytoin therapy may lead tohyperplasia of the gums, which may be relieved by conscientious oralhygiene. Instruct the patient to report adverse effects immediately. When administering phenytoin I.V., use a large vein and monitor vitalsigns frequently or administer fosphenytoin (Cerebyx), which has fewervascular side effects. Avoid I.M. administration and mixing with dextrosesolutions. Another I.V. altemative is levetiracetam. Emphasize the importance of having anticonvulsant blood levels checkedat regular intervals, even if the seizures are under control. Wam the patient against drinking alcoholic beverages. Know which social agencies in your community can help epilepticpatients. Refer the patient to the Epilepsy Foundation of America forgeneral information and to the state motor vehicle department forinformation about a driver s license.The primary goals of the healthcare professional and family memberscaring for a patient having a seizure are protection from injury, protectionfrom aspiration, and observation of the seizure activity. Generalized tonic clonic seizures may necessitate first aid. Show the patient s family membershow to administer first aid correctly: Avoid restraining the patient during a seizure. Help the patient to a lyingposition, loosen any tight clothing, and place something flat and soft, suchas a pillow, jacket, or hand, under head. Clear the area of hard objects.Don force anything into the patient s mouth if the teeth are clenched atongue blade or spoon could lacerate a mouth and lips or displace teeth,",20,119
379,"precipitating respiratory distress. However, if the patient s mouth is open,protect the tongue by placing a soft object (such as a folded cloth)between the teeth. Tum the head to provide an open airway. After theseizure subsides, reassure the patient that he or she is all right, orient totime and place, and inform that he or she has had a seizure. Don t restrain the patient during a complex partial seizure. Clear the areaof any hard objects. Protect the patient from injury by gently calling his orher name and directing away from the source of danger. After the seizurepasses, reassure and tell the patient that he or she has just had a seizure.Brain and Spinal Cord Disorders STROKEA stroke, also called cerebrovascular accident or brain attack, is a suddenimpairment of cerebral circulation in one or more of the blood vesselssupplying the brain. A stroke interrupts or diminishes oxygen supply andcommonly causes serious damage or necrosis in brain tissues. The soonercirculation retums to normal after a stroke, the better chances are forcomplete recovery. However, about half of those who survive a strokeremain permanently disabled and experience a recurrence within weeks,months, or years.Causes and Incidence A stroke results from obstruction of a blood vessel, typically in extracerebralvessels, but occasionally in intracerebral vessels. Factors that increase therisk of stroke include history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs),atherosclerosis, hypertension, kidney disease, arrhythmias (specifically atrialfibrillation), electrocardiogram changes, rheumatic heart disease, diabetesmellitus, postural hypotension, cardiac or myocardial enlargement, highserum triglyceride levels, lack of exercise, use of oral contraceptives,cigarette smoking, and a family history of stroke. (See Zransient ischemicattack, page 171.)Transient Ischemic Attack",14,95
380,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient episode of neurologicdysfunction caused by a brain ischemia without acute infarct. It s usuallyconsidered a waming sign of an impending thrombotic stroke. In fact,TIAs have been reported in 50 to 80 of patients who have had acerebral infarction from such thrombosis. The age of onset varies.Incidence rises dramatically after age 50 and is highest among blacks andmen.Causes In TIA, microemboli released from a thrombus probably temporarilyinterrupt blood flow, especially in the small distal branches of thearterial tree in the brain. Small spasms in those arterioles may impairblood flow and also precede TIA. Predisposing factors are the same asfor thrombotic strokes. The most distinctive characteristics of TIAs arethe transient duration of neurologic deficits and complete retum ofnormal function. The symptoms of TIA easily correlate with the locationof the affected artery. These symptoms include double vision, speechdeficits (slurring or thickness), unilateral blindness, staggering oruncoordinated gait, unilateral weakness or numbness, falling because ofweakness in the legs, and dizziness.Treatment During an active TIA, treatment aims to prevent a completed stroke andconsists of aspirin or anticoagulants to minimize the risk of thrombosis.After or between attacks, preventive treatment includes carotidendarterectomy or cerebral microvascular bypass.The major causes of stroke are thrombosis, embolism, and hemorrhage.Thrombosis is the most common cause in middle-aged and elderly people,who have a higher incidence of atherosclerosis, diabetes, and hypertension.Thrombosis causes ischemia in brain tissue supplied by the affected vesselas well as congestion and edema; the latter may produce more clinical effectsthan thrombosis itself, but these symptoms subside with the edema.Thrombosis may develop while the patient sleeps or shortly after the patientawakens; it can also occur during surgery or after a myocardial infarction.",9,99
381,"The risk increases with obesity, smoking, or the use of oral contraceptives.Cocaine-induced ischemic stroke is now being seen in younger patients.Embolism, the second most common cause of stroke, is an occlusion of ablood vessel caused by a fragmented clot, a tumor, fat, bacteria, or air. It canoccur at any age, especially among patients with a history of rheumatic heartdisease, endocarditis, posttraumatic valvular disease, myocardial fibrillationand other cardiac arrhythmias, or after open heart surgery. It usually developsrapidly in 10 to 20 seconds and without waming. When an embolusreaches the cerebral vasculature, it cuts off circulation by lodging in anarrow portion of an artery, most commonly the middle cerebral artery,causing necrosis and edema. (See Ischemic stroke, page 172.) If the embolusis septic and infection extends beyond the vessel wall, encephalitis or anabscess may develop.Ischemic Stroke The illustrations below show common sites of cardiac thrombosis andthe resulting sites of embolism and infarction.",6,52
382,"COMMON SITES OF PLAQUE FORMATION, EMBOLISM, AND INFARCTIONAnterior cerebral artery Middle cerebral artery Posterior cerebral artery Anterior inferiorcerebellar artery Posterior inferior.COMMON SITES OF CARDIAC THROMBosis CDEllar artery artery Intemal carotid artery Emboli Vertebral artery Common carotid artery Atrial fibrillation Ball thrombus Bacterial endocarditis Mitral valvestenosis Embolus Myocardial infarction Mural thrombus Hemorrhage, the third most common cause of stroke, may, like embolism,occur suddenly, at any age, and affects more women than men. Hemorrhageresults from chronic hypertension or aneurysms, which cause sudden ruptureof a cerebral artery, thereby diminishing blood supply to the area served bythe artery. In addition, blood accumulates deep within the brain, furthercompressing neural tissue and causing even greater damage.Strokes are classified according to their course of progression. Aprogressive stroke, or stroke-in-evolution (thrombus-in-evolution), beginswith a slight neurologic deficit and worsens in a day or two. In a completedstroke, usually embolic in nature, neurologic deficits are maximal at onset.",5,50
383,"Stroke is the third most common cause of death in most developedcountries today and the most common cause of neurologic disability. It occursin of 15 deaths in the United States each year.Pathophysiology Cerebral infarction occurs when an area of the brain has lost its bloodsupply. This results in a core of irreversible ischemia and necrosis. Thecentral core is surrounded by a border of ischemic tissue which is stillsalvageable tissue. The best window of time to preserve the tissue in thepenumbra is within the first 3 hours.Within 6 to 12 hours the affected areas pale and soften; necrosis, swelling,and mushy disintegration of the infarcted area appears within 48 to 72 hours.Complications Unstable blood pressure Fluid imbalances Infection Sensory impairment Altered LOC Aspiration Pulmonary emboli Signs and Symptoms Clinical features of stroke vary with the artery affected (and, consequently,the portion of the brain it supplies), the severity of damage, and the extent ofcollateral circulation that develops to help the brain compensate fordecreased blood supply. If the stroke occurs in the left hemisphere, itproduces symptoms on the right side; if in the right hemisphere, symptoms areon the left side. However, a stroke that causes cranial nerve damageproduces signs of cranial nerve dysfunction on the same side as thehemorrhage.Symptoms are usually classified according to the artery affected:Middle cerebral artery: aphasia, dysphasia, visual field cuts, andhemiparesis on affected side (more severe in the face and arm than in theleg)",7,83
384,"Carotid artery: weakness, paralysis, numbness, sensory changes, andvisual disturbances on affected side; altered LOC, bruits, headaches,aphasia, and ptosis Vertebrobasilar artery: weakness on affected side, numbness around lipsand mouth, visual field cuts, diplopia, poor coordination, dysphagia,slurred speech, dizziness, amnesia, and ataxia Anterior cerebral artery: confusion, weakness, and numbness (especiallyin the leg) on affected side, incontinence, loss of coordination, impairedmotor and sensory functions, and personality changes Posterior cerebral arteries: visual field cuts, sensory impairment,dyslexia, coma, and cortical blindness; typically, paralysis is absent.Symptoms can also be classified as premonitory, generalized, and focal.Premonitory symptoms, such as drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and mentalconfusion, are rare. Generalized symptoms, such as headache, vomiting,mental impairment, seizures, coma, nuchal rigidity, fever, and disorientation,are typical. Focal symptoms, such as sensory and reflex changes, reflect thesite of hemorrhage or infarct and may worsen.Diagnosis Diagnosis of stroke is based on the observation of clinical features, a historyof risk factors, and the results of diagnostic tests:CT scan shows evidence of hemorrhagic stroke immediately but may notshow evidence of thrombotic infarction for 48 to 72 hours.MRI may help identify ischemic or infarcted areas and cerebral swelling. Electrocardiogram can help diagnose underlying heart disorders. Carotid duplex may detect carotid artery stenosis.Angiography outlines blood vessels and pinpoints occlusion or rupturesite.Other baseline laboratory studies may be done to exclude immuneconditions or abnormal clotting that can lead to clot formation.Treatment Surgery performed to improve cerebral circulation for patients withthrombotic or embolic stroke includes endarterectomy (removal ofatherosclerotic plaques from the inner arterial wall) and microvascular",5,118
385,"bypass (surgical anastomosis of an extracranial vessel to an intracramalvessel). Angioplasty and stenting can improve arterial circulation to thebrain. Mechanical embolectomy/clot removal can be done within 8 hours ofonset of symptoms.Medications useful in stroke include the following: Tissue plasminogen activator has been used successfully in clotdissolution when administered within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms. Inother circumstances, heparin and warfarin (Coumadin) may be used, aswell as aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs. Clopidogrel, an antiplatelet drug, may be more effective than aspirin inpreventing stroke and reducing the risk of recurrent stroke after therapyhas begun. Anticonvulsants may be used to treat or prevent seizures. Stool softeners may be used to prevent straining, which increases ICP. Analgesics may be used to relieve the headache that typically followshemorrhagic stroke.Special Considerations During the acute phase, efforts focus on survival needs and prevention offurther complications. Effective care emphasizes continuing neurologicassessment, support of respiration, continuous monitoring of vital signs,careful positioning to prevent aspiration and contractures, management of GIproblems, and careful monitoring of fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional status.Patient care must also include measures to prevent complications such asinfection. Maintain a patent airway and oxygenation. Loosen constricting clothes.Watch for ballooning of the cheek with respiration. The side that balloonsis the side affected by the stroke. If the patient is unconscious, it ispossible that he or she could aspirate saliva, so keep the patient inalateral position to allow secretions to drain naturally or suctionsecretions, as needed. Insert an artificial airway, and start mechanicalventilation or supplemental oxygen, if necessary. Check vital signs and neurologic status, record observations, and reportany significant changes to the physician. Monitor blood pressure, LOC,pupillary changes, motor function (voluntary and involuntary movements),sensory function, speech, skin color, temperature, signs of increased ICP,",16,115
386,"and nuchal rigidity or flaccidity. Remember, if stroke is impending, bloodpressure rises suddenly, pulse is rapid and bounding, and the patient maycomplain of a headache. Also, watch for signs of pulmonary emboli, suchas chest pains, shortness of breath, dusky color, tachycardia, fever, andchanged sensorium. If the patient is unresponsive, monitor the blood gasesoften and alert the physician to increased partial pressure of carbondioxide or decreased partial pressure of oxygen. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. If the patient can take liquidsorally, offer them as often as fluid limitations permit. Administer I.V.fluids as ordered; never give too much too fast because this can increase ICP. Offer the urinal or bedpan every 2 hours. If the patient is incontinent,he or she may need an indwelling urinary catheter, but this should beavoided, if possible, because of the risk of infection. Ensure adequate nutrition. Check for gag reflex before offering small oralfeedings of semisolid foods. Place the food tray within the patient s visualfield because loss of peripheral vision is common. If oral feedings aren tpossible, insert a nasogastric tube. Manage GI problems. Be alert to signs that the patient is straining atelimination because this increases ICP. Modify diet, administer stoolsofteners, as indicated, and give laxatives, if necessary. If the patientvomits (usually during the first few days), keep positioned on the side toprevent aspiration. Provide careful mouth care. Clean and irrigate the patient s mouth toremove food particles. Care for the dentures as needed. Provide meticulous eye care. Remove secretions with a cotton ball andsterile normal saline solution. Instill eye drops as ordered. Patch thepatient s affected eye if the patient can t close the lid. Position the patient and align the extremities correctly. Use splints toprevent foot drop and contracture, use convoluted foam, flotation, orpulsating mattresses, or sheepskin, to prevent pressure ulcers. To preventpneumonia, tum the patient at least every 2 hours. Elevate the affectedhand to control dependent edema, and place it in a functional position.Mobilize the patient as soon as hemodynamic stability is achieved. Assist the patient with exercise. Perform range-of-motion exercises forboth the affected and unaffected sides. Teach and encourage the patient touse the unaffected side to exercise the affected side.Give medications as ordered, and watch for and report adverse effects.",31,132
387,"Establish and maintain communication with the patient. If the patient isaphasic, set up a simple method of communicating basic needs. Then,remember to phrase your questions so the patient will be able to answerusing this system. Repeat yourself quietly and calmly, and use gestures ifnecessary to help the patient understand. Even an unresponsive patientmay be able to hear, so don t say anything in their presence you wouldn twant the patient to hear and remember.Provide psychological support. Set realistic short-term goals. Involve thepatient s family in care when possible, and explain the deficits andstrengths.If the patient has a visual field deficit, make sure caregivers and familymembers approach the patient from his visually intact side.For a patient who has had a stroke, start rehabilitation at admission. Theamount of teaching you ll have to do depends on the extent of neurologicdeficit.If necessary, teach the patient to comb hair, dress, and wash. With the aidof a physical therapist and an occupational therapist, obtain appliances,such as walking frames, hand bars by the toilet, and ramps, as needed. Thepatient may fail to recognize that they have a paralyzed side (calledunilateral neglect) and must be taught to inspect that side of the body forinjury and to protect it from harm. If speech therapy is indicated,encourage the patient to begin as soon as possible and to follow throughwith the speech pathologist s suggestions. To reinforce teaching, involvethe patient s family in all aspects of rehabilitation. With their cooperationand support, devise a realistic discharge plan, and let them help decidewhen the patient can retum home.Before discharge, wam the patient or family to report any premonitorysigns of a stroke, such as severe headache, drowsiness, confusion, anddizziness. Emphasize the importance of regular follow-up visits.If aspirin has been prescribed to minimize the risk of embolic stroke, tellthe patient to watch for possible GI bleeding. Make sure the patient andfamily realize that acetaminophen isn t a substitute for aspirin. To help prevent stroke: Stress the need to control diseases, such as diabetes or hypertension. Teach all patients (especially those at high risk) the importance offollowing a low-cholesterol, low-salt diet; watching their weight;",16,108
388,"increasing activity; avoiding smoking and prolonged bed rest; andminimizing stress. (See Preventing stroke, page 175.)PREVENTIONPREVENTING STROKELifestyle modifications can help prevent heart attack and stroke.The American Heart Association recommends the following:Healthy Diet Give patients the following advice: Eat five or more servings of fruit and vegetables daily. Eat six or more servings a day of grain products including wholegrains. Eat fish at least twice a week, especially mackerel, lake trout,herring, sardines, albacore tuna, and salmon. Include fat-free and low-fat milk products, beans, lean meats, andskinless poultry. Choose fats and oils with 2 g or less of saturated fat per serving (1tablespoon). Limit your intake of foods high in calories or low in protein, suchas carbonated beverages, high-sugar foods, and candy. Eat less than 6 g of salt per day (1 teaspoon). Limit foods high in saturated fat, trans fat, or cholesterol, such aswhole milk, fatty meats, tropical oils, and partially hydrogenatedvegetable oils.Exercise Regular physical activity is defined by the American Heart Association as moderate to vigorous exercise 30 minutes a day onmost or all days of the week. A lack of physical activity can lead toobesity and increase the risk of hypertension, heart attack, and stroke.Smoking Cessation",11,82
389,"Even smoking filtered and light or ultralight cigarettes can lead toatherosclerosis. Quitting or not starting is the only thing that canprevent this major risk factor for heart attack and stroke.Blood Pressure Awareness Individuals should know what their blood pressure is by having itchecked by a practitioner. If it s high, it may be able to be lowered byfollowing a healthy diet and including exercise in their daily routine.If diet and exercise don t lower blood pressure, medication may beneeded. Adherence to the medication regimen is foremost in reducingblood pressure and preventing stroke. Ensure that the patient understands that if symptoms develop, he or sheshould go to the emergency department immediately.MENINGITISIn meningitis, the brain and the spinal cord meninges become inflamed,usually as a result of a viral or, less commonly, a bacterial infection. Suchinflammation may involve all three meningeal membranes the dura mater,the arachnoid, and the pia mater. (See Meningeal inflammation inmeningitis, page 175.) Viral meningitis is usually mild and often clears on itsown in 10 days or less. Bacterial meningitis requires prompt treatment with LV. antibiotics.Meningeal Inflammation in Meningitis The illustration below shows normal meninges and how the meningesbecome inflamed in meningitis.",10,63
390,"NORMAL MENINGES INFLAMMATION IN MENINGITISArachnoid Swelling of themeninges,interfering withnormal brainfunctioning Dura Pia mater es,Causes and Incidence Bacterial meningitis is almost always a complication of another bacterialinfection bacteremia (especially from pneumonia, empyema, osteomyelitis,or endocarditis), sinusitis, otitis media, encephalitis, myelitis, or brainabscess usually caused by Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilusinfluenzae (in children and young adults), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (inadults). In some cases, a virus is suspected. (See Lymphocyticchoriomeningitis.) Meningitis may also follow skull fracture, a penetratinghead wound, lumbar puncture, or a ventricular shunting procedure. Asepticmeningitis may result from a virus or other organism. Sometimes, nocausative organism can be found. Meningitis commonly begins as aninflammation of the pia-arachnoid, which may progress to congestion ofadjacent tissues and destruction of some nerve cells.Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is a mild, biphasic, febrile illnesslasting about 2 weeks. Infection occurs through inhalation of the LCMvirus or arenavirus from infectious aerosolized particles of the host(rodents such as mice or hamsters) or its excreta (urine, feces, or saliva)1 to 3 weeks before the onset of symptoms. It can also result from contact",9,71
391,"with food contaminated with the virus or by contamination of mucousmembranes, skin lesions, or cuts with infected body fluids. Handlers ofinfected animals or their excreta are at risk for this disease. Most casesoccur in the northeast and eastem seaboard areas of the United States.LCM is more common during fall and winter.The incubation period is 8 to 13 days after exposure. Earlycharacteristics include fever, malaise, anorexia, weakness, muscle aches,retro-orbital headache, nausea, and vomiting. Sore throat, nonproductivecough, joint pain, chest pain, testicular pain, and parotid (salivary gland)pain may occur. Meningeal symptoms appear in 15 to 21 days, with signsand symptoms of meningitis (fever, increased headache, and stiff neck) orencephalitis (drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and motorabnormalities such as paralysis). Alopecia may also occur.Complications include temporary or permanent neurologic damage,possible matemal transmission (pregnancy-related infection is associatedwith spontaneous abortion, congenital hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, andmental retardation), myelitis, Guillain Barré-type syndrome, orchitis orparotitis, myocarditis, psychosis, joint pain and arthritis, and prolongedconvalescence with continuing dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue.Diagnosis is made by detection of immunoglobulin M antibodies byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from serum or cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) (the preferred diagnostic test). Lumbar puncture CSF is typicallyabnormal and reveals increased opening pressure, increased proteinlevels, and a lymphocytic pleocytosis, usually in the range of severalhundred white blood cells. Treatment is generally supportive andincludes bed rest, anti-inflammatory drugs, and analgesics. Ribavirin hasbeen shown to be effective against LCM in vitro. Acute hydrocephalusmay require surgical shunting to relieve increased intracranial pressure.Prevention involves teaching rodent control measures, basic hygienepractices, use of a personal respirator, importance of adequateventilation, and use of a liquid disinfectant, such as a diluted householdbleach solution, to clean areas with rodent droppings.The incidence of meningitis is high among Blacks and Native Americans.Male infants have a high incidence of gram-negative neonatal meningitis.",11,124
392,"Pathophysiology Microorganisms invade the CNS through the nose or mouth, along a cranialor peripheral nerve, through a direct opening such as trauma or through thebloodstream. This sets off an inflammatory response in the meninges, exudateforms in the subarachnoid space causing the CSF to thicken. The exudate alsoirritates the cerebral cortex. This results in increased ICP.Complications Visual impairment Optic neuritis Cranial nerve palsies Personality changes Headache Paresis or paralysis Vasculitis Endocarditis Signs and Symptoms The cardinal signs of meningitis are infection (fever, chills, and malaise) andincreased ICP (headache, vomiting, and, rarely, papilledema). Signs ofmeningeal irritation include nuchal rigidity, positive Brudzinski and Kemigsigns, exaggerated and symmetrical deep tendon reflexes, and opisthotonos (aspasm in which the back and extremities arch backward so that the body restson the head and heels). (See Two signs of meningitis, page 177.) Othermanifestations of meningitis are irritability; sinus arrhythmias; photophobia,diplopia, and other visual problems; and delirium, deep stupor, and coma.Two Signs of Meningitis Brudzinski sign: Place the patient in a dorsal recumbent position, putyour hands behind the patient s neck, and bend it forward. Pain andresistance may indicate meningeal inflammation, neck injury, or arthritis.If the patient also flexes hips and knees in response to this manipulation,chances are the patient has meningitis.",8,90
393,"Kemig sign: Place the patient in a supine position. Flex the leg at thehip and knee and then straighten the knee. Pain or resistance points tomeningitis. An infant may not show clinical signs of infection but may be fretful andrefuse to eat. Such an infant may vomit often, leading to dehydration; thisprevents a bulging fontanel and thus masks this important sign of increased ICP. As the illness progresses, twitching, seizures (in 30 of infants), or",6,28
394,"coma may develop. Most older children have the same symptoms as adults.In subacute meningitis, the onset may be insidious.Diagnosis A lumbar puncture showing typical CSF findings, when accompanied bypositive Brudzinski and Kemig signs, usually establishes a diagnosis. Thefollowing tests can uncover the primary sites of infection: cultures of blood,urine, and nose and throat secretions; chest X-ray; electrocardiogram; and aphysical examination, with special attention to skin, ears, and sinuses.Lumbar puncture usually indicates elevated CSF pressure, from obstructedoutflow at the arachnoid villi. The fluid may appear cloudy or milky white,depending on the number of white blood cells present. CSF protein levelstend to be high; glucose levels may be low. (In subacute meningitis, CSFfindings may vary.) CSF culture and sensitivity tests usually identify theinfecting organism, unless it s a virus. Leukocytosis and serum electrolyteabnormalities are also common. CT scan can rule out cerebral hematoma,hemorrhage, or tumor.Treatment Treatment of meningitis includes appropriate antibiotic therapy for bacterialmeningitis and vigorous supportive care. Usually, I.V. antibiotics are givenfor at least 2 weeks, followed by oral antibiotics. Dexamethasone has beenshown to be effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of meningitiscaused by H. influenzae type B and in pneumococcal meningitis if givenbefore the first dose of antibiotic. It has also been shown to reduce theincidence of deafness, a common complication of meningitis.Other drugs include mannitol to decrease cerebral edema, ananticonvulsant (usually given I.V.) or sedative to reduce restlessness, andaspirin or acetaminophen to relieve headache and fever. Supportivemeasures include bed rest, fever reduction, and measures to preventdehydration. The patient s room is kept darkened and quiet because anyincrease in sensory stimulation may cause a seizure. Isolation is necessary ifnasal cultures are positive. Appropriate therapy for any coexistingconditions, such as endocarditis or pneumonia, is included as well. Toprevent meningitis, prophylactic antibiotics are sometimes used afterventricular shunting procedures, skull fracture, or penetrating head wounds,but this use is controversial.",19,123
395,"For viral meningitis, treatment is supportive.Special Considerations Patients must be watched carefully for changes in neurologic function orother signs of worsening condition. Assess neurologic function often. Observe LOC and signs of increased ICP (plucking at the bedcovers, vomiting, seizures, and a change in motorfunction and vital signs). Watch for signs of cranial nerve involvement(ptosis, strabismus, and diplopia).Vv ALERT Be especially alert for a temperature increase up to 102 F(38.9 C), deteriorating LOC, onset of seizures, and alteredrespirations, all of which may signal an impending crisis.Monitor fluid balance. Maintain adequate fluid intake to avoiddehydration, but avoid fluid overload because of the danger of cerebraledema. Measure central venous pressure and intake and output accurately. Watch for adverse effects of I.V. antibiotics and other drugs. To avoidinfiltration and phlebitis, check IV. site often, and change the siteaccording to hospital policy. Position the patient carefully to prevent joint stiffness and neck pain. Tumthe patient often, according to a planned positioning schedule. Assist withrange-of-motion exercises. Maintain adequate nutrition and elimination. It may be necessary toprovide small, frequent meals or to supplement meals with nasogastrictube or parenteral feedings. To prevent constipation and minimize the riskof increased ICP resulting from straining at stool, give the patient a mildlaxative or stool softener. Ensure the patient s comfort. Provide mouth care regularly. Maintain aquiet environment. Darkening the room may decrease photophobia.Relieve headache with a nonopioid analgesic, such as aspirin oracetaminophen, as ordered. (Opioids interfere with accurate neurologicassessment.) Provide reassurance and support. The patient may be frightened by theillness and frequent lumbar punctures. If the patient is delirious orconfused, attempt to reorient often. Reassure the family that the deliriumand behavior changes caused by meningitis usually disappear. However,",26,123
396,"if a severe neurologic deficit appears permanent, refer the patient to arehabilitation program as soon as the acute phase of this illness haspassed. To help prevent development of meningitis, teach patients with chronicsinusitis or other chronic infections the importance of proper medicaltreatment. Follow strict sterile technique when treating patients with headwounds or skull fractures. . PREVENTION Give Haemophilus influenzae Type B and pneumococcal vaccines tochildren. Give meningococcal vaccine to college students. Give prophylactic antibiotics to those who have been exposed to apatient with meningitis.ENCEPHALITISEncephalitis is a severe inflammation of the brain, commonly caused by amosquito-bome or, in some areas, a tick-bome virus. However, transmissionby means other than arthropod bites may occur through ingestion of infectedgoat s milk and accidental injection or inhalation of the virus. Person-to-person, airbome transmission of viruses (such as measles or mumps) mayalso lead to encephalitis in nonimmunized populations. Eastem equineencephalitis may produce permanent neurologic damage and is commonlyfatal. (See Types of encephalitis, pages 179 to 181.)Types of Encephalitis Four main viral agents cause most cases of encephalitis in the United States: eastem equine encephalitis (EEE), westem equine encephalitis(WEE), St. Louis encephalitis, and La Crosse (LAC) encephalitis, all ofwhich are transmitted by mosquitoes. Another virus, Powassan (POW)virus, is a minor cause of encephalitis in the northem United States; thisvirus is transmitted by ticks. Most cases of arboviral encephalitis occurfrom June through September, when arthropods are most active. In milder",15,85
397,"parts of the country, where arthropods are active late into the year, casescan occur into the winter months.No vaccines are available for these U.S.-based diseases. However, a Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine is available for those who will betraveling to Japan, a tick-bome encephalitis vaccine is available forthose who will be traveling to Europe, and an equine vaccine isavailable for EEE, WEE, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE).Public health measures often require spraying of insecticides to killlarvae and adult mosquitoes as well as controlling standing water thatcan provide mosquito breeding sites.Eastem Equine Encephalitis EEE is caused by an alphavirus transmitted to humans and horses bythe bite of an infected mosquito. Incubation is 4 to 10 days. Symptoms begin with a sudden onset of fever, general muscle pains,and a headache of increasing severity; can progress to seizures andcoma. One third of those afflicted will die from the disease and of those whorecover, many will suffer irreversible brain damage requiring care. Human cases are usually preceded by outbreaks in horses. The virus occurs in natural cycles involving birds in swampy areasnearly every year during the warm months. The virus doesn t escapefrom these areas, however, and this mosquito doesn t usually bitehumans or other mammals.Westem Equine Encephalitis The alphavirus WEE is the causative agent. The virus is closelyrelated to the EEE and VEE viruses. The enzootic cycle of WEE involves passerine birds, in which theinfection is inapparent, and culicine mosquitoes, principally Culextarsalis, a species associated with irrigated agriculture and streamdrainages. Human WEE cases are usually first seen in June or July. Most WEE infections are asymptomatic or present as mild,nonspecific illness. Patients with clinically apparent illness usuallyhave a sudden onset with fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia,",13,119
398,"and malaise, followed by altered mental status, weakness, and signsof meningeal irritation.Children, especially those younger than age 1, are affected moreseverely than adults and may be left with permanent sequelae, whichare seen in 5 to 30 of young patients.Mortality is about 3 .. Louis Encephalitis The leading cause of St. Louis encephalitis is a flavivirus. St. Louisencephalitis is the most common mosquito-transmitted humanpathogen in the United States.Mosquitoes become infected by feeding on birds infected with the St.Louis encephalitis virus. Infected mosquitoes then transmit virus tohumans and animals during the feeding process. The virus grows bothin the infected mosquito and the infected bird, but doesn t make eitherone sick.Less than 1 of St. Louis encephalitis viral infections are clinicallyapparent; the majority are undiagnosed.Illness ranges in severity from a simple febrile headache tomeningoencephalitis, with an overall case fatality ratio of 30 .The incubation period is 5 to 15 days.Mild infections present with fever and headache. More severeinfection is marked by headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor,disorientation, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions (especially ininfants), and spastic (but rarely flaccid) paralysis.The disease is generally milder in children than in adults, but in thosechildren who do have disease, there s a high rate of encephalitis.Elderly people are at highest risk for severe disease and death.During the summer season, St. Louis encephalitis virus is maintainedin a mosquito bird mosquito cycle, with periodic amplification byperidomestic birds and Culex mosquitoes.La Crosse encephalitis The LAC virus, a bunyavirus, is a zoonotic pathogen cycled betweenthe daytime-biting tree hole mosquito, Aedes triseriatus, andvertebrate amplifier hosts (chipmunks, tree squirrels) in deciduousforest habitats. The virus is maintained over the winter by",6,105
399,"transmission in mosquito eggs. If the female mosquito is infected, shemay lay eggs that carry the virus. The vector uses artificial containers(tires, buckets, and so forth) in addition to tree holes.LAC encephalitis initially presents as a nonspecific summertimeillness with fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and lethargy.Severe disease occurs most commonly in children younger than 16and is characterized by seizures, coma, paralysis, and a variety ofneurologic sequelae after recovery.Death occurs in less than 1 of clinical cases.Cases are often reported as aseptic meningitis or viral encephalitis ofunknown etiology.During an average year, about 75 cases of LAC encephalitis arereported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Powassan Encephalitis The POW virus is a flavivirus.Recently a Powassan-like virus was isolated from the deer tick,Ixodes scapularis. The virus has been recovered from ticks (Ixodesmarxi and Dermacentor andersoni) and from the tissues of an eastemspotted skunk.It s a rare cause of acute viral encephalitis.Patients who recover may have residual neurologic problems.Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Like EEE and WEE viruses, VEE is an alphavirus that causesencephalitis in horses and humans. VEE is a significant veterinary andpublic health problem in Central and South America.Infection of humans with the VEE virus is less severe than with EEEand WEE viruses, and fatalities are rare.Adults usually develop only an influenza-like illness; overtencephalitis is usually confined to children.Effective VEE virus vaccines are available for equines.Japanese Encephalitis JE virus, which is related to St. Louis encephalitis, is a flavivirus. It swidespread throughout Asia.",6,97
400,"Epidemics occur in late summer in temperate regions, but the infectionis enzootic and occurs throughout the year in many tropical areas of Asia.The virus is maintained in a cycle involving culicine mosquitoes andwaterbirds. It s transmitted to humans by Culex mosquitoes, primarily Culex tritaeniorhynchus, which breed in rice fields.Mosquitoes become infected by feeding on domestic pigs and wildbirds infected with the JE virus. Infected mosquitoes then transmit thevirus to humans and animals during the feeding process. The virus isamplified in domestic pigs and wild birds.The incubation period is 5 to 14 days.Mild infections occur without apparent symptoms other than feverwith headache. More severe infection is marked by quick onset,headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma,tremors, occasional seizures (especially in infants), and spastic (butrarely flaccid) paralysis.The illness resolves in 5 to 7 days if there s no central nervous systeminvolvement.The mortality is less than 10 , but is higher in children and canexceed 30 . Neurologic sequelae in patients who recover arereported in up to 30 of cases.A vaccine is currently available for human use in the United States forindividuals who might be traveling to endemic countries.Tick-Bome Encephalitis Tick-bome encephalitis (TBE) is caused by two closely relatedflaviviruses. The eastem subtype causes Russian spring-summerencephalitis (RSSE) and is transmitted by /xodes persulcatus,whereas the westem subtype is transmitted by Ixodes ricinus andcauses Central European encephalitis (CEE).RSSE is the more severe infection, having a mortality of up to 25 insome outbreaks, whereas mortality in CEE seldom exceeds 5 .The incubation period is 7 to 14 days. Infection usually presents as a mild, influenza-type illness or as benign,aseptic meningitis, but may result in fatal meningoencephalitis. Fever is often biphasic, and there may be severe headache and neckrigidity, with transient paralysis of the limbs, shoulders or, less",9,119
401,"commonly, the respiratory musculature. A few patients are left withresidual paralysis.Although the great majority of TBE infections follow exposure toticks, infection has occurred through the ingestion of infected cows orgoats milk.An inactivated TBE vaccine is currently available in Europe and Russia.West Nile Encephalitis West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus belonging to the Japaneseencephalitis serocomplex that includes the closely related St. Louisencephalitis virus, Kunjin, and Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE)viruses, as well as others.WNYV can infect a wide range of vertebrates; in humans it usuallyproduces either asymptomatic infection or mild febrile disease, butcan cause severe and fatal infection in a small percentage of patients.The incubation period is thought to range from 3 to 14 days.Symptoms generally last 3 to 6 days.Like St. Louis encephalitis virus, WNV is transmitted principally by Culex species mosquitoes, but also can be transmitted by Aedes,Anopheles, and other species.The mild form of WNV infection has presented as a febrile illness ofsudden onset often accompanied by malaise, anorexia, nausea,vomiting, eye pain, headache, myalgia, rash, and lymphadenopathy.A minority of patients with severe disease develop a maculopapularor morbilliform rash involving the neck, trunk, arms, or legs. Somepatients experience severe muscle weakness and flaccid paralysis.Neurologic presentations include ataxia, cranial nerve abnormalities,myelitis, optic neuritis, polyradiculitis, and seizures. Although notobserved in recent outbreaks, myocarditis, pancreatitis, and fulminanthepatitis have been described.Murray Valley Encephalitis MVE is endemic in New Guinea and in parts of Australia.It s related to the St. Louis encephalitis, WNYV, and JE viruses.Infections are common, and the small number of fatalities has mostlybeen in children.",4,103
402,"In encephalitis, intense lymphocytic infiltration of brain tissues and theleptomeninges causes cerebral edema, degeneration of the brain s ganglioncells, and diffuse nerve cell destruction.Causes and Incidence Encephalitis typically results from infection with arboviruses specific torural areas. However, in urban areas, it s most frequently caused byenteroviruses (coxsackievirus, poliovirus, and echovirus) and flaviviruses(WNV). Other causes include herpesvirus, mumps virus, humanimmunodeficiency virus, adenoviruses, rabies, and demyelinating diseasesafter measles, varicella, rubella, or vaccination.Pathophysiology Infectious organisms from a mosquito or tick causes a lymphocyticinfiltration of brain tissues and the leptomeninges which causes cerebraledema, degeneration of the ganglion cells of the brain with diffuse nerve celldestruction.Complications Bronchial pneumonia Urine retention Urinary tract infection Pressure ulcers Seizure disorder Parkinsonism Mental deterioration Coma Signs and Symptoms All viral forms of encephalitis have similar clinical features, although certaindifferences do occur. Usually, the acute illness begins with sudden onset offever, headache, and vomiting and progresses to include signs and symptomsof meningeal irritation (stiff neck and back) and neuronal damage(drowsiness, coma, paralysis, seizures, ataxia, tremors, nausea, vomiting,",4,72
403,"and organic psychoses). After the acute phase of the illness, coma maypersist for days or weeks.The severity of arbovirus encephalitis may range from subclinical torapidly fatal necrotizing disease. Herpes encephalitis also produces signsand symptoms that vary from subclinical to acute and commonly fatalfulminating disease. Associated effects include disturbances of taste orsmell.Diagnosis During an encephalitis epidemic, diagnosis is readily made on clinicalfindings and patient history. However, sporadic cases are difficult todistinguish from other febrile illnesses, such as gastroenteritis or meningitis.Diagnosis may be assisted by serologic assays, such as immunoglobulin (Ig)M-capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA) and Ig ELISA. Early in infection, Ig Mantibody is more specific, whereas later, Ig G is more reactive. Monoclonalantibody studies show promise in diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction isalso being investigated.When possible, identification of the virus in CSF or blood confirms thisdiagnosis. The common viruses that also cause herpes, measles, and mumpsare easier to identify than arboviruses. Both herpesviruses and arbovirusescan be isolated by inoculating young mice with a specimen taken from thepatient. In herpes encephalitis, serologic studies may show rising titers ofcomplement-fixing antibodies.In all forms of encephalitis, CSF pressure is elevated and despiteinflammation, the fluid is usually clear. White blood cell and protein levelsin CSF are slightly elevated, but the glucose level remains normal. An EEGreveals abnormalities. Occasionally, a CT scan or MRI may be ordered torule out cerebral hematoma.Treatment The antiviral acyclovir must be prescribed for herpes encephalitis.Antibiotics may be prescribed if the infection is thought to be caused bybacteria. Treatment of all other forms of encephalitis is entirely supportive.Drug therapy includes phenytoin or another anticonvulsant, usually given IV;steroids such as dexamethasone to reduce cerebral inflammation and edema;corticosteroids; mannitol to reduce cerebral swelling (although the evidencefor benefit is weak); sedatives for restlessness; and aspirin or acetaminophen",15,109
404,"to relieve headache and reduce fever. Ribavirin and interferon alpha-2bwere found to have some effect on West Nile encephalitis. Other supportivemeasures include adequate fluid and electrolyte intake to prevent dehydrationand antibiotics for an associated infection such as pneumonia. Isolation isunnecessary. (See Preventing mosquito-bome encephalitis.)PREVENTIONPREVENTING MOSQUITO-BORNEENCEPHALITISHelp patients prevent mosquito-bome encephalitis by urging them tofollow these steps: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants if going outside between duskand dawn. A mosquito repellent with a 10 to 30 concentration of N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) is recommended and should beapplied to skin and clothing. Don t use DEET on the hands of youngchildren or on infants under 2 months of age. Cover an infant s strolleror playpen with mosquito netting when outside. Refrain from unnecessary activity in places where mosquitoes aremost prevalent. Repair holes in screens on doors and windows to prevent mosquitoesfrom entering the home. Eliminate areas that attract mosquitoes, such as standing water inbirdbaths, wheelbarrows, flower pots, old tires, and unusedcontainers. These items are excellent breeding areas for mosquitoes.Special Considerations During the acute phase of the illness: Assess neurologic function often. Observe LOC and signs of increased ICP (increasing restlessness, plucking at the bedcovers, vomiting,seizures, and changes in pupil size, motor function, and vital signs suchas rising blood pressure, widening pulse pressure, and slowly falling",14,88
405,"pulse). Watch for cranial nerve involvement (ptosis, strabismus, anddiplopia), abnormal sleep pattems, and behavior changes. Maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration, but avoid fluidoverload, which may increase cerebral edema. Measure and record intakeand output accurately, and assess daily weights. Carefully position the patient to prevent joint stiffness and neck pain, andtum the patient often. Assist with range-of-motion exercises.Maintain adequate nutrition. It may be necessary to give the patient small,frequent meals or to supplement meals with nasogastric tube or parenteralfeedings. To prevent constipation and minimize the risk of increased ICP resultingfrom straining at stool, give a mild laxative or stool softener. Provide mouth care. Maintain a quiet environment. Darkening the room may decreasephotophobia and headache. If the patient naps during the day and isrestless at night, plan daytime activities to minimize napping and promotesleep at night. Provide emotional support and reassurance because the patient is apt tobe frightened by the illness and frequent diagnostic tests. Ifthe patient is delirious or confused, attempt to reorient often. Providinga calendar or a clock in the patient s room may be helpful. Reassure the patient and family that behavior changes caused byencephalitis usually disappear. If a neurologic deficit is severe andappears permanent, refer the patient to a rehabilitation program as soon asthe acute phase has passed.BRAIN ABSCESSBrain abscess, also known as an intracranial abscess, is a free orencapsulated collection of pus usually in the temporal lobe, cerebellum, orfrontal lobes. It can vary in size and may occur singly or in more than onelocation.Untreated brain abscess is usually fatal; even with treatment, the prognosisis only fair, and about 30 of patients develop focal seizures. Multiplemetastatic abscesses secondary to systemic or other infections have thepoorest prognosis.Causes and Incidence",19,114
406,"Brain abscess is usually secondary to some other infection, especially otitismedia, sinusitis, dental abscess, and mastoiditis. Other causes includesubdural empyema; bacterial endocarditis; human immunodeficiency virusinfection; bacteremia; pulmonary or pleural infection; pelvic, abdominal, andskin infections; and cranial trauma, such as a penetrating head wound orcompound skull fracture. Brain abscess also occurs in those with congenitalheart disease and congenital blood vessel abnormalities of the lungs such as Osler Weber Rendu disease. These disorders carry a high risk of infectionof the heart or lungs, which can then spread to the brain. Penetrating headtrauma or bacteremia usually leads to staphylococcal infection; pulmonarydisease, to streptococcal infection.Brain abscess has a relatively low incidence. It has a 10 mortality rate.Pathophysiology Brain abscess usually begins with localized inflammatory necrosis andedema, septic thrombosis of vessels, and suppurative encephalitis. This isfollowed by thick encapsulation of accumulated pus and adjacent meningealinfiltration by neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The abscess actslike a space-occupying lesion. If the capsule of the abscess ruptures, itcreates a more diffuse inflammation with more global increased ICP.Complications Seizures Permanent weakness or paralysis Meningitis Memory difficulty Speech difficulty Signs and Symptoms Onset varies according to cause, but generally brain abscess producesclinical effects similar to those of a brain tumor. Early symptoms result fromincreased ICP and include constant intractable headache, worsened bystraining; nausea; vomiting; and focal or generalized seizures. Typical latersymptoms include ocular disturbances, such as nystagmus, decreased vision,and unequal pupil size.Other features differ with the site of the abscess:",11,99
407,"temporal lobe abscess: auditory-receptive dysphasia, central facialweakness, and hemiparesis cerebellar abscess: dizziness, coarse nystagmus, gaze weakness on lesionside, tremor, and ataxia frontal lobe abscess: expressive dysphasia, hemiparesis with unilateralmotor seizure, drowsiness, inattention, and mental function impairment.Signs of infection, such as fever, pallor, and bradycardia, are absent untillate stages unless they result from the predisposing condition. If the abscessis encapsulated, they may never appear. Depending on abscess size andlocation, LOC varies from drowsiness to deep stupor.Diagnosis A history of infection especially of the middle ear, mastoid, nasal sinuses,heart, or lungs or a history of congenital heart disease, along with aphysical examination showing such characteristic clinical features asincreased ICP, points to brain abscess. A CT scan or MRI and, occasionally,arteriography (which highlights brain abscess by a halo) help locate the site.Blood culture will reveal any bacteria in the bloodstream. Chest X-ray mayreveal lung infection.Examination of CSF can help confirm infection, but lumbar puncture isrisky because it can release the increased ICP and provoke cerebralhemiation. A CT-guided stereotactic biopsy may be performed to drain andculture the abscess. Other tests include culture and sensitivity of drainage toidentify the causative organism, skull X-rays, and a radioisotope scan.Treatment Management of patients with brain abscess has become increasinglychallenging because of the proliferation of unusual bacterial, fungal, andparasitic infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Therapyconsists of antibiotics to combat the underlying infection and surgicalaspiration or drainage of the abscess. Surgical drainage or excision may beperformed (CT scan or MRI can help determine the need for theseprocedures). Antimicrobials may be injected directly into the mass.Administration of antibiotics for at least 2 weeks before surgery can reducethe risk of spreading infection.",10,108
408,"Other treatments during the acute phase are palliative and supportive andinclude mechanical ventilation, administration of IV. fluids with diuretics(urea, mannitol, or hypertonic saline), to combat increased ICP and cerebraledema. Anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin, levetiracetam, or phenobarbital,help prevent seizures.Special Considerations The patient with an acute brain abscess requires intensive monitoring. Frequently assess neurologic status, especially LOC, speech, andsensorimotor and cranial nerve functions. Watch for signs of increased ICP (decreased LOC, vomiting, abnormal pupil response, and depressedrespirations), which may lead to cerebral hemiation with such signs asfixed and dilated pupils, widened pulse pressure, bradycardia ortachycardia, and absent respirations. Assess and record vital signs at least every hour. Monitor fluid intake and output carefully because fluid overload cancontribute to cerebral edema.If surgery is necessary, explain the procedure to the patient and answer anyquestions. After surgery: Continue frequent neurologic assessment. Monitor vital signs and intakeand output. Watch for signs of meningitis (nuchal rigidity, headaches, chills, andsweats), an ever present threat. Be sure to change a damp dressing often, using sterile technique andnoting the amount of drainage. Never allow bandages to remain damp. Topromote drainage and prevent reaccumulation of purulent material in theabscess, position the patient on the operative side. If the patient remains stuporous or comatose for an extended period, givemeticulous skin care to prevent pressure ulcers, and position to preservefunction and prevent contractures. Encourage the patient to ambulate as soon as possible to preventimmobility and encourage independence.BESEEa SM PREVENTION",15,101
409,"Stress the need for treatment of otitis media, mastoiditis, dentalabscess, and other infections. Give prophylactic antibiotics after compound skull fracture orpenetrating head wound.HUNTINGTON DISEASEAlso called Huntington chorea, hereditary chorea, chronic progressivechorea, or adult chorea, Huntington disease is a hereditary disease in whichdegeneration in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia causes chronicprogressive chorea and mental deterioration, ending in dementia.Causes and Incidence Huntington disease is inherited as a single faulty gene on chromosome 4whereby part of the gene is repeated in multiple copies. It s transmitted as anautosomal dominant trait; either sex can transmit and inherit it. Each child ofa parent with this disease has a 50 chance of inheriting it.The disease usually strikes people between ages 35 and 55; however, 2 of cases occur in children, and 5 of cases occur as late as age 60. Deathusually results 10 to 15 years after onset, from suicide, heart failure, orpneumonia. Genetic testing is available for persons with a family history ofthe disease.Pathophysiology Huntington disease involves a disturbance in neurotransmitters primarilygamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and dopamine. GABA neurons in thebasal ganglia, frontal cortex, and cerebellum are destroyed and replaced byglial cells which create a deficiency of GABA and an excess of dopamine.This imbalance alters neural transmission along the affected pathway.Complications Aspiration Pneumonia Heart failure Infections Suicidal ideation",7,83
410,"Signs and Symptoms Onset is insidious. The patient eventually becomes totally dependent emotionally and physically through loss of musculoskeletal control, anddevelops progressively severe choreic movements. Such movements arerapid, usually violent, and purposeless. Initially, they re unilateral and moreprominent in the face and arms than in the legs, progressing from mildfidgeting to grimacing, tongue smacking, dysarthria (indistinct speech),athetoid movements (especially of the hands) related to emotional state, andtorticollis.Ultimately, the patient with Huntington disease develops progressivedementia, although the dementia doesn t always progress at the same rate asthe chorea. Dementia can be mild at first, but eventually causes severedisruption of the personality. Personality changes include obstinacy,carelessness, untidiness, moodiness, apathy, inappropriate behavior, loss ofmemory and concentration and, occasionally, paranoia.Diagnosis Huntington disease can be detected by positron emission tomography anddeoxyribonucleic acid analysis. Diagnosis is based on a characteristicclinical history: progressive chorea and dementia, onset in early middle age(35 to 40 years old), and confirmation of a genetic link. CT scan and MRIdemonstrate brain atrophy. Molecular genetics may detect the gene for Huntington disease in people at risk while they re still asymptomatic.Treatment Because Huntington disease has no known cure, treatment is supportive,protective, and symptomatic. Dopamine blockers, such as phenothiazine orhaloperidol, help control choreic movements and reduce abnormalbehaviors. Reserpine and other drugs have been used with varying success tocontrol choreic movements and reduce abnormal behavior. Drugs such astetrabenazine and amantadine are used to control extra movements. Someevidence suggests that co-enzyme Q10 may minimally decrease progressionof the disease. Institutionalization may be necessary because of mentaldeterioration, which can t be halted or managed by drugs.Special Considerations",14,107
411,"Patient comfort and support are the primary considerations. Provide physical support by attending to the patient s basic needs, such ashygiene, skin care, bowel and bladder care, and nutrition. Increase thissupport as mental and physical deterioration make the patient increasinglyimmobile. Offer emotional support to the patient and family. Teach them about thedisease, and listen to their concems and special problems. Keep in mindthe patient s dysarthria, and allow extra time to express himself, therebydecreasing frustration. Teach the family to participate in the patient s care. Stay alert for possible suicide attempts. Control the patient s environmentto protect from suicide or other self-inflicted injury. Pad the side rails ofthe bed, but avoid restraints, which may cause the patient to injure himselfwith violent, uncontrolled movements.If the patient has difficulty walking, provide a walker to help maintainbalance.Make sure affected families receive genetic counseling. All affectedfamily members should realize that each of their offspring has a 50 chance of inheriting this disease.Refer people at risk who desire genetic testing to centers specializing in Huntington s care, where psychosocial support is available. Refer the patient and family to the appropriate community organizations. For more information about this degenerative disease, refer the patientand family to the Huntington s Disease Society of America.PARKINSON DISEASENamed for James Parkinson, the English physician who wrote the firstaccurate description of the disease in 1817, Parkinson diseasecharacteristically produces progressive muscle rigidity, akinesia, involuntarytremor, and dementia. Death may result from aspiration pneumonia or aninfection.Causes and Incidence Although the cause of Parkinson disease is unknown, study of theextrapyramidal brain nuclei (corpus striatum, globus pallidus, and substantianigra) has established that a dopamine deficiency prevents affected brain",14,96
412,"cells from performing their normal inhibitory function within the CNS.Parkinson disease occurs in families in some cases.Parkinson disease, also called parkinsonism, paralysis agitans, andshaking palsy, is one of the most common crippling diseases in the United States. Parkinson disease strikes 2 in every 1,000 people, most oftendeveloping in those older than 50; however, it also occurs in children andyoung adults. Because of increased longevity, this amounts to roughly 60,000new cases diagnosed annually in the United States alone. Incidence increasesin persons with repeated brain injury, including professional athletes, andpersons using psychoactive substances, whether prescribed or illicit.Pathophysiology Parkinson is a degenerative process involving the dopaminergic neurons inthe substantia nigra. Stimulation of the basal ganglia usually results in refinedmotor response because acetylcholine (excitatory) and dopamine (inhibitory)are balanced. The degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons results in animbalance leading to excess acetylcholine at the synapse. The result isrigidity, tremors, and bradykinesia.Complications Injury from falls Aspiration Urinary tract infections Skin breakdown Signs and Symptoms The cardinal symptoms of Parkinson disease are muscle rigidity and akinesiaand an insidious resting tremor that begins in the fingers (unilateral pill-rolltremor), increases during stress or anxiety, and decreases with purposefulmovement and sleep. Muscle rigidity results in resistance to passive musclestretching, which may be uniform (lead-pipe rigidity) or jerky (cogwheelrigidity). Akinesia causes the patient to walk with difficulty (gait lacksnormal parallel motion and may be retropulsive or propulsive) and producesa high-pitched, monotone voice; drooling; a masklike facial expression; lossof posture control (the patient walks with body bent forward); and dysarthria,dysphagia, or both. Occasionally, akinesia may also cause oculogyric crises",10,106
413,"(eyes are fixed upward, with involuntary tonic movements) orblepharospasm (eyelids are completely closed). Parkinson disease itselfdoesn t impair the intellect, but a coexisting disorder, such asarteriosclerosis, may do so.Diagnosis Generally, laboratory data are of little value in identifying Parkinson disease;consequently, diagnosis is based on the patient s age, history, andcharacteristic clinical picture.Conclusive diagnosis is possible only after ruling out other causes oftremor, involutional depression, cerebral arteriosclerosis and, in patientsyounger than 30, intracranial tumors, Wilson disease, or phenothiazine orother drug toxicity.Treatment Because Parkinson disease has no cure, the primary aim of treatment is torelieve symptoms and keep the patient functional as long as possible.Treatment consists of drugs, physical therapy and, in severe disease statesunresponsive to drugs, stereotactic neurosurgery or the controversialtreatment called fetal cell transplantation. In this treatment, fetal brain tissueis injected into the patient s brain. If the injected cells grow within therecipient s brain, they will allow the brain to process dopamine, therebyeither halting or reversing disease progression. Neurotransplantationtechniques, including the use of nerve cells from other parts of the patient sbody, have been attempted with varying results.Drug therapy usually includes levodopa, a dopamine replacement that smost effective during early stages. It s given in increasing doses untilsymptoms are relieved or adverse effects appear. Because adverse effectscan be serious, levodopa is usually given in combination with carbidopa tohalt peripheral dopamine synthesis. Occasionally, levodopa provesineffective, producing dangerous adverse effects that include posturalhypotension, hallucinations, and increased libido leading to inappropriatesexual behavior. In that case, altemative drug therapy includesanticholinergics such as_ trihexyphenidyl, antihistamines such asdiphenhydramine, and amantadine, an antiviral agent.Research into the oxidative stress theory has caused a controversy in drugtherapy for Parkinson disease. Traditionally, levodopa carbidopa has been a",10,102
414,"first-line drug in management; however, it has also been associated with anacceleration of disease process. Inclusion of entacapone potentiates theeffects of levodopa carbidopa treatment so that less frequent doses arerequired.Selegiline, an enzyme-inhibiting agent, allows conservation of dopamineand enhances the therapeutic effect of levodopa. Selegiline used withtocopherols delays the time when the patient with Parkinson disease becomesdisabled.Cy mee TIP Elderly patients may need smaller doses ofantiparkinsonian drugs because of reduced tolerance. Be alert forand report orthostatic hypotension, irregular pulse, blepharospasm, andanxiety or confusion.When drug therapy fails, stereotactic neurosurgery, such assubthalamotomy and pallidotomy, may be an altemative. In these procedures,electrical coagulation, freezing, radioactivity, or ultrasound destroys theventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus to prevent involuntary movement. Thisis most effective in young, otherwise healthy people with unilateral tremor ormuscle rigidity. Neurosurgery can only relieve symptoms. Brain stimulatorimplantation alters the activity of the area where Parkinson diseasesymptoms originate. A pacemaker is implanted into the chest wall, and theelectrode is threaded (using MRI for guidance) to the thalamus, pallidum, orsubthalamic nucleus. A successful procedure reduces the need formedication, thus reducing the medication-related adverse effects experiencedby the patient.Individually planned physical therapy complements drug treatment andneurosurgery to maintain normal muscle tone and function. Appropriatephysical therapy includes both active and passive range-of-motion exercises,routine daily activities, walking, and baths and massage to help relaxmuscles.Special Considerations Effectively caring for the patient with Parkinson disease requires carefulmonitoring of drug treatment, emphasis on teaching self-reliance, andgenerous psychological support.",11,99
415,"Monitor drug treatment and adjust dosage, if necessary, to minimizeadverse effects. If the patient has surgery, watch for signs of hemorrhage and increased ICP by frequently checking LOC and vital signs.Encourage independence. The patient with excessive tremor may achievepartial control of his or her body by sitting on a chair and using its arms tosteady themselves. Advise the patient to change position slowly anddangle the legs before getting out of bed. Remember that fatigue may causethe patient to depend more on others. Help the patient overcome problems related to eating and elimination. Forexample, if the patient has difficulty eating, offer supplementary or small,frequent meals to increase caloric intake. Help establish a regular bowelroutine by encouraging the patient to drink at least 2 qt (about 2 L) ofliquids daily and eat high-fiber foods. The patient may need an elevatedtoilet seat to assist froma standing to a sitting position. Give the patient and family emotional support. Teach them about thedisease, its progressive stages, and drug adverse effects. Show the familyhow to prevent pressure ulcers and contractures by proper positioning.Inform them of the dietary restrictions levodopa imposes, and explainhousehold safety measures to prevent accidents. Help the patient andfamily express their feelings and frustrations about the progressivelydebilitating effects of the disease. Establish long- and short-term treatmentgoals, and be aware of the patient s need for intellectual stimulation anddiversion. Refer the patient and family to the National Parkinson Foundation or the United Parkinson Foundation for more information.MYELITIS AND ACUTE TRANSVERSE MYELITISMyelitis, or inflammation of the spinal cord, can result from severaldiseases. Poliomyelitis affects the cord s gray matter and produces motordysfunction; leukomyelitis affects only the white matter and produces sensorydysfunction. These types of myelitis can attack any level of the spinal cord,causing partial destruction or scattered lesions. Acute transverse myelitis,which affects the entire thickness of the spinal cord, produces both motor andsensory dysfunctions. It has a rapid onset and is the most devastating form ofmyelitis.The prognosis depends on the severity of cord damage and prevention ofcomplications. If spinal cord necrosis occurs, prognosis for complete",20,118
416,"recovery is poor. Even without necrosis, residual neurologic deficits usuallypersist after recovery. Patients who develop spastic reflexes early in thecourse of the illness are more likely to recover than those who don t.Causes and Incidence Acute transverse myelitis has a variety of causes. It commonly follows acuteinfectious diseases, such as measles or pneumonia (the inflammation occursafter the infection has subsided), and primary infections of the spinal corditself, such as syphilis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Acutetransverse myelitis can accompany demyelinating diseases, such as an acuteexacerbation of MS, and inflammatory and necrotizing disorders of the spinalcord such as hematomyelia.Certain toxic agents (carbon monoxide, lead, and arsenic) can cause a typeof myelitis in which acute inflammation (followed by hemorrhage andpossible necrosis) destroys the entire circumference (myelin, axis cylinders,and neurons) of the spinal cord. Other forms of myelitis may result frompoliovirus, herpes zoster, herpesvirus B, or rabies virus; disorders that causemeningeal inflammation, such as syphilis, abscesses and other suppurativeconditions, and tuberculosis; smallpox or polio vaccination; parasitic andfungal infections; and chronic adhesive arachnoiditis.Peak incidence occurs between 10 and 19 years old, then again between30 and 39. Approximately 1,400 new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States. About 33,000 Americans have some type of disability fromthis disorder.Pathophysiology Caused by an acute infection, myelitis is an inflammation of the spinal cord.It can affect only the gray matter which leads to motor dysfunction, or it canaffect the white matter which leads to sensory dysfunction. In acute transversmyelitis the entire cord is affected leading to both motor and sensory deficits.Complications Hypertension Urinary tract infection Urolithiasis Pneumonia",9,90
417,"Skeletal and smooth muscle deformities Myocarditis Paralytic ileus Signs and Symptoms In acute transverse myelitis, onset is rapid, with motor and sensorydysfunctions below the level of spinal cord damage appearing in to 2 days.Patients with acute transverse myelitis develop flaccid paralysis of thelegs (sometimes beginning in just one leg) with loss of sensory and sphincterfunctions. Such sensory loss may follow pain in the legs or trunk. Reflexesdisappear in the early stages but may reappear later. The extent of damagedepends on the level of the spinal cord affected; transverse myelitis seldominvolves the arms. If spinal cord damage is severe, it may cause shock(hypotension and hypothermia).Diagnosis Paraplegia of rapid onset usually points to acute transverse myelitis. In suchpatients, neurologic examination confirms paraplegia or neurologic deficitbelow the level of the spinal cord lesion and absent (or, in later stages)hyperactive reflexes. CSF may be normal or show increased lymphocytes orelevated protein levels. Diagnostic evaluation must rule out spinal cordtumor and identify the cause of any underlying infection.Treatment No effective treatment exists for acute transverse myelitis. However, thiscondition requires appropriate treatment of any underlying infection. Somepatients with postinfectious or MS-induced myelitis have received steroidtherapy, but its benefits aren t clear.Special Considerations Managing symptoms and treating the underlying infection are the primaryconsiderations. Frequently assess vital signs. Watch carefully for signs of spinal shock(hypotension and excessive sweating). Prevent contractures with range-of-motion exercises and properalignment.",13,79
418,"Watch for signs of urinary tract infections from indwelling urinarycatheters. Prevent skin infections and pressure ulcers with meticulous skin care.Check pressure points often and keep skin clean and dry; use a low-pressure specialty or rotational bed or other pressure-relieving device.Initiate rehabilitation immediately. Assist the patient with physicaltherapy, bowel and bladder training, and the lifestyle changes thecondition requires.ALZHEIMER DISEASEAlzheimer disease, also called primary degenerative dementia, accounts formore than half of all dementias. It results in memory loss, confusion,impaired judgment, personality changes, disorientation, and loss of languageskills. Because this is a primary progressive dementia, the prognosis for apatient with this disease is poor.Causes and Incidence The cause of Alzheimer disease is unknown; however, several factors arethought to be implicated in this disease. These include neurochemicalfactors, such as deficiencies in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine,somatostatin, substance P, and norepinephrine; environmental factors; andgenetic immunologic factors. Genetic studies show that an autosomaldominant form of Alzheimer disease is associated with early onset and earlydeath, accounting for about 100,000 deaths a year. A family history of Alzheimer disease and the presence of Down syndrome are two establishedrisk factors. Alzheimer disease isn t exclusive to the elder population; itsonset begins in middle age in 1 to 10 of cases.The brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer disease has three hallmarkfeatures: neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and granulovasculardegeneration. Examination of the brain after death also finds that it satrophic, commonly weighing less than 1,000 g, compared with a normalbrain weight of about 1,380 g. (See Tissue changes in Alzheimer disease,page 189.)Tissue Changes in Alzheimer Disease",11,90

There issignificant brain tissue loss and loss of cholinergic pathways in the frontal",3,43
420,"lobe and hippocampus which are responsible for memory and cognitivefunction.Complications Injury Pneumonia Infection Malnutrition Dehydration Signs and Symptoms Onset is insidious. Initially, the patient undergoes almost imperceptiblechanges, such as forgetfulness, recent memory loss, difficulty leaming andremembering new information, deterioration in personal hygiene andappearance, and an inability to concentrate. Gradually, tasks that requireabstract thinking and activities that require judgment become more difficult.Progressive difficulty in communication and severe deterioration in memory,language, and motor function result in a loss of coordination and an inabilityto write or speak. Personality changes (restlessness, irritability) andnoctumal awakenings are common.Patients also exhibit loss of eye contact, a fearful look, wringing of thehands, and other signs of anxiety. When someone with Alzheimer disease isoverwhelmed with anxiety, he or she becomes dysfunctional, acutelyconfused, agitated, compulsive, or fearful.Eventually, the patient becomes disoriented, and emotional lability andphysical and intellectual disability progress. The patient becomessusceptible to infection and accidents. Usually, death results from infection.Diagnosis Early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is difficult because the patient s signsand symptoms are subtle. (See Organic brain syndrome.) Diagnosis relieson an accurate history from a reliable family member, mental status andneurologic examinations, and psychometric testing. A positron emissiontomography scan measures the metabolic activity of the cerebral cortex andmay help in early diagnosis. An EEG and a CT scan may help in laterdiagnosis. Currently, the disease is diagnosed by exclusion; that is, tests are",12,96
421,"performed to rule out other disorders. The presence of Alzheimer diseasecan t be confirmed until death, when pathologic findings are revealed atautopsy.Organic Brain Syndrome Although many behavioral disturbances are clearly linked to organicbrain dysfunction, the clinical syndromes associated with this type ofimpairment are sometimes hard to detect because they aren t alwaysdetermined by the affected area of the brain or even by the extent of tissuedamage. Instead, the way the patient s personality interacts with the braininjury determines the specific clinical effects. General symptoms ofteninclude impairment of orientation, memory, and intellectual andemotional function. These primary cognitive deficits help to distinguishorganic brain syndromes from neurosis and depression.Diagnosis Diagnosis of an organic brain syndrome depends on a detailed history ofthe onset of cognitive and behavioral disturbances; a complete neurologicassessment; and such tests as EEG, computed tomography scans, brain X-rays, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and psychological studies. Organicbrain syndromes are classified by etiology and specific clinical effects.Causes include infection, brain trauma, nutritional deficiency,cerebrovascular disease, degenerative disease, tumor, toxins, andmetabolic or endocrine disorders.Treatment Effective treatment requires correction of the underlying cause. Specialconsiderations may include reality orientation, emotional support for thepatient and the family, a safe environment, mat therapy for an agitated oraggressive patient, and referral for psychological counseling.Treatment Therapy consists of attempts to slow disease progression, manage behavioralproblems, modify the home environment, and elicit family support. Some",8,83
422,"medications have proven helpful. Tacrine, a _ centrally actinganticholinesterase agent, is given to treat memory deficits. It has slowedprogression of the disease and improved cognitive function in some patients.Other agents include donepezil and rivastigmine. Memantine hydrochloridereduces chemical actions in the brain that contribute to the symptoms of Alzheimer disease. Underlying disorders that contribute to the patient sconfusion, such as hypoxia, are also identified and treated.Special Considerations Overall care is focused on supporting the patient s remaining abilities andcompensating for those lost. Establish an effective communication system with the patient and family tohelp them adjust to the patient s altered cognitive abilities. Offer emotional support to the patient and family members. Behaviorproblems may be worsened by excess stimulation or change in establishedroutine. Teach them about the disease, and refer them to social service andcommunity resources for legal and financial advice and support. Anxiety may cause the patient to become agitated or fearful. Intervene byhelping the patient focus on another activity. Provide the patient with a safe environment. Encourage the patient toexercise, as ordered, to help maintain mobility.CREUTZFELDT JAKOB DISEASECreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, rapidly progressive viral diseasethat attacks the CNS, causing dementia and neurologic signs and symptoms,such as myoclonic jerking, ataxia, aphasia, visual disturbances, andparalysis. CJD is always fatal. A new variant of CJD (v CJD) emerged in Europe in 1996. (See Understanding v CJD, page 191.)Understanding v CJDLike conventional Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the variant of thedisease (v CJD) is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease. Most caseshave been reported in the United Kingdom. v CJD is most likely causedby exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) a fatal brain",19,101
423,"disease in cattle also known as mad cow disease via ingestion of beefproducts from cattle with BSE.v CJD affects patients at a much younger age (younger than 55) than CJD, and the duration of the illness is much longer (14 months).Regulations have been established in Europe to control outbreaks of BSE in cattle and to prevent contaminated meat from entering the foodsupply.Causes and Incidence The causative organism is difficult to identify because no foreign ribonucleicacid or deoxyribonucleic acid has been linked to the disease. CJD isbelieved to be caused by a specific protein called a prion, which lacksnucleic acids, resists proteolytic digestion, and spontaneously aggregates inthe brain. Most cases are sporadic; 5 to 15 are familial, with anautosomal dominant pattem of inheritance. Although CJD isn t transmitted bynormal casual contact, human-to-human transmission can occur as a result ofcertain medical procedures, such as comeal and cadaveric dura mater grafts.Isolated cases have resulted from childhood treatment with harvested humangrowth hormone and from improperly decontaminated neurosurgicalinstruments and brain electrodes.CJD typically affects adults 40 to 65 years old and occurs in more than 50countries. Males and females are affected equally. In people younger than 30,the incidence is 5 in billion; in all other age groups, the incidence is 1 in 1million.Pathophysiology Caused by prions which are deviant forms of harmless proteins found in thebrains of mammals and birds. As the prions replicate, they convert normalforms of the protein into their abnormal shape. As the prions accumulate intothe nerve cell, they cause neurodegeneration.Complications Impaired gait Incontinence Akinetic mute state",8,93
424,"Bronchopneumonia Death Signs and Symptoms Early signs and symptoms of mental impairment may include slowness inthinking, difficulty concentrating, impaired judgment, and memory loss.Dementia is progressive and occurs early. Involuntary movements, such asmuscle twitching, trembling, and peculiar body movements, and visualdisturbances appear with disease progression and advancing mentaldeterioration. Hallucinations are also common. The duration of the typicalillness is 4 months.Diagnosis CJD must be considered for anyone with signs of progressive dementia.Neurologic examination is the most effective tool in diagnosing CJD.Difficulty with rapid altemating movements and point-to-point movementsare typically evident early in the disease.An EEG may be performed to assess the patient for typical changes inbrain wave activity. CT scan, MRI of the brain, and lumbar puncture may beuseful in ruling out other disorders that cause dementia. Though notdiagnostic, the presence of the 14-3-3 protein in the spinal fluid is highlysuggestive of the disease when it s accompanied by other characteristicsymptoms. Definitive diagnosis usually isn t obtained until an autopsy isdone and brain tissue is examined.Treatment There s no cure for CJD, and its progress can t be slowed. Palliative care isprovided to make the patient comfortable and to ease symptoms. Medicationsmay be needed to control aggressive behaviors. These include sedatives andantipsychotics.The need to provide a safe environment, control aggressive or agitatedbehavior, and meet physiologic needs may require monitoring and assistancein the home or in an institutionalized setting. Family counseling may help incoping with the changes required for home care.Behavior modification may be helpful, in some cases, for controllingunacceptable or dangerous behaviors. Reality orientation, with repeated",12,95
425,"reinforcement of environmental and other cues, may help reducedisorientation.Legal advice may be appropriate early in the course of the disorderregarding advance directives, power of attomey, and other legal actions thatmay make it easier to make ethical decisions regarding the care of anindividual with CJD.Special Considerations Offer emotional support to the patient and family. Teach them about thedisease, and assist them through the grieving process. Refer the patientand family to CJD support groups, and encourage participation. Contact social services and hospice, as appropriate, to assist the familywith their needs. Encourage the patient and family to discuss and complete advancedirectives. To prevent disease transmission, use caution when handling body fluidsand other materials from patients suspected of having CJD.REYE SYNDROMEReye syndrome is an acute illness affecting children and, less commonly,adults. It causes fatty infiltration of the liver with concurrenthyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and increased ICP. In addition, fattyinfiltration of the kidneys, brain, and myocardium may occur.Prognosis depends on the severity of CNS depression. Until recently,mortality was as high as 90 . Today, ICP monitoring and, consequently,early treatment of increased ICP, along with other treatment measures, havecut mortality to about 20 . Death is usually a result of cerebral edema orrespiratory arrest. Comatose patients who survive may have residual braindamage.Causes and Incidence Reye syndrome typically begins within to 3 days of an acute viral infection,such as an upper respiratory tract infection, type B influenza, or varicella(chickenpox). Incidence commonly rises during influenza outbreaks and maybe linked to salicylate use. For this reason, use of aspirin for childrenyounger than 15 isn t recommended. The Reye s Syndrome Foundation wams",15,88
426,"against the use of salicylates, even in topical preparations, when a viralillness is suspected.In Reye syndrome, damaged hepatic mitochondria disrupt the urea cycle,which normally changes ammonia to urea for its excretion from the body.This results in hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, and an increase in serumshort-chain fatty acids, leading to encephalopathy. Simultaneously, fattyinfiltration occurs in renal tubular cells, neuronal tissue, and muscle tissue,including the heart.Reye syndrome affects children from infancy to adolescence and occursequally in boys and girls. Peak incidence is at 6 years old.Pathophysiology Reye syndrome is the result of damaged hepatic mitochondria which disruptsthe urea cycle. The result is hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, and anincrease in serum short-chain fatty acids which leads to encephalopathy.Complication Increased ICPSigns and Symptoms The severity of the child s signs and symptoms varies with the degree ofencephalopathy and cerebral edema. In any case, Reye syndrome develops infive stages. After the initial viral infection, a brief recovery period followswhen the child doesn t seem seriously ill. A few days later, the patientdevelops intractable vomiting; lethargy; rapidly changing mental status (mildto severe agitation, confusion, irritability, and delirium); rising bloodpressure, respiratory rate, and pulse rate; and hyperactive reflexes.Reye syndrome commonly progresses to coma. As coma deepens, seizuresdevelop, followed by decreased tendon reflexes and, usually, respiratoryfailure.Increased ICP, a serious complication, is now considered the result of anincreased cerebral blood volume causing intracranial hypertension. Suchswelling may develop as a result of acidosis, increased cerebral metabolicrate, and an impaired autoregulatory mechanism.Diagnosis",8,97
427,"A history of a recent viral disorder with typical clinical features stronglysuggests Reye syndrome. An increased serum ammonia level, abnormalclotting studies, and hepatic dysfunction confirm it. Testing serum salicylatelevel rules out aspirin use. Absence of jaundice despite increased liveraminotransferase levels rules out acute hepatic failure and hepaticencephalopathy.Abnormal test results may include: Liver function studies aspartate aminotransferase and alanineaminotransferase elevated to twice normal levels; bilirubin level usuallynormal. Liver biopsy fatty droplets uniformly distributed throughout cells. CSF analysis white blood cell count less than 10/u L; with coma,increased CSF pressure.Coagulation studies prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin timeprolonged.Blood values serum ammonia levels elevated; serum glucose levelsnormal or, in 15 of cases, low; serum fatty acid and lactate levelsincreased.Treatment For treatment guidelines, see Stages of treatment for Reye syndrome.Stages of Treatment for Reye Syndrome Signs and Baseline treatment Baseline interventionsymptoms",6,60

Recovery is spontaneous and complete in about 95 ofpatients, although mild motor or reflex deficits in the feet and legs maypersist. The prognosis is best when symptoms clear between 15 and 20 daysafter onset.Causes and Incidence Precisely what causes Guillain-Barré syndrome is unknown, but it may be acell-mediated immunologic attack on peripheral nerves in response to avirus. The major pathologic effect is segmental demyelination of theperipheral nerves. Because this syndrome causes inflammation anddegenerative changes in both the posterior (sensory) and anterior (motor)nerve roots, signs of sensory and motor losses occur simultaneously.This syndrome (also called infectious polyneuritis, Landry Guillain Barré syndrome, and acute idiopathic polyneuritis) can occur at any age butis most common between 30 and 50 years old; it affects both sexes equally.In the United States, it has an incidence of 0.6 to 2.4 cases per 100,000people.",7,73
430,"Pathophysiology Guillain-Barré is the result of segmental demyelination of the peripheralnerves resulting in inflammation and swelling. The result is impairment ofimpulse transmission along the dorsal and anterior nerve roots motor andsensory loss occurs simultaneously.Complications Thrombophlebitis Pressure ulcers Contractures Muscle wasting Aspiration Respiratory tract infections Respiratory and cardiac compromise Signs and Symptoms About 50 of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome have a history of minorfebrile illness (10 to 14 days before onset), usually an upper respiratory tractinfection or, less commonly, gastroenteritis with Campylobacter jejuni.When infection precedes onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome, signs ofinfection subside before neurologic features appear. Other possibleprecipitating factors include surgery; rabies or swine influenza vaccination,viral illness such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis, and HIV;Hodgkin or other malignant disease; and lupus erythematosus.Symmetrical muscle weakness, the major neurologic sign, usually appearsin the legs first (ascending type) and then extends to the arms and facialnerves in 24 to 72 hours. Sometimes, muscle weakness develops in the armsfirst (descending type) or in the arms and legs simultaneously. (See Jestingfor thoracic sensation, page 195.) In milder forms of this disease, muscleweakness may affect only the cranial nerves or may not occur at all.Testing for Thoracic Sensation When Guillain-Barré syndrome progresses rapidly, test for ascendingsensory loss by touching the patient or pressing the skin lightly with a pin",6,73
431,"every hour. Move systematically from the iliac crest (T12) to the scapula,occasionally substituting the blunt end of the pin to test the patient sability to discriminate between sharp and dull.Mark the level of diminished sensation to measure any change. Ifdiminished sensation ascends to T8 or higher, the patient s intercostalmuscle function (and consequently respiratory function) will probably beimpaired. As Guillain-Barré syndrome subsides, sensory and motorweakness descends to the lower thoracic segments, heralding a retum ofintercostal and extremity muscle function.",4,31
432,"SEGMENTAL DISTRIBUTION OF SPINALNERVES TO BACK OF THE BODY Key: T, thoracic segments.Another common neurologic sign is paresthesia, which sometimesprecedes muscle weakness but tends to vanish quickly. However, some",2,8
433,"patients with this disorder never develop this symptom. Other clinicalfeatures may include facial diplegia (possibly with ophthalmoplegia),dysphagia or dysarthria and, less commonly, weakness of the musclessupplied by cranial nerve XI. Muscle weakness develops so quickly thatmuscle atrophy doesn t occur, but hypotonia and areflexia do. Stiffness andpain in the form of a severe charley horse commonly occur.The clinical course of Guillain-Barré syndrome is divided into threephases. The initial phase begins when the first definitive symptom appearsand ends 1 to 3 weeks later, when no further deterioration manifests. Theplateau phase lasts several days to 2 weeks and is followed by the recoveryphase, which is believed to coincide with remyelination and axonal processregrowth. The recovery phase extends over a period of 4 to 6 months;patients with severe disease may take up to 2 years to recover, and recoverymay not be complete.Diagnosis A history of febrile illness (usually a respiratory tract infection) and typicalclinical features suggest Guillain-Barre syndrome.Several days after onset of signs and symptoms, CSF protein levels beginto rise, peaking in 4 to 6 weeks, probably as a result of widespreadinflammatory disease of the nerve roots. CSF white blood cell count remainsnormal, but in severe disease, CSF pressure may rise above normal.Probably because of predisposing infection, CBC shows leukocytosis and ashift to immature forms early in the illness, but blood studies soon retum tonormal. Electromyography may show repeated firing of the same motor unitinstead of widespread sectional stimulation. Nerve conduction velocities areslowed soon after paralysis develops and show demyelination. Diagnosismust rule out similar diseases such as acute poliomyelitis.Treatment Treatment is primarily supportive, including such measures as endotracheal(ET) intubation or tracheotomy if the patient has difficulty clearingsecretions. Preventing complications is another goal of treatment.Plasmapheresis is useful in decreasing severity of symptoms, therebyfacilitating a more rapid recovery. I.V. immune globulin is equally effectivein reducing the severity and duration of symptoms.",14,103
434,"Special Considerations Monitoring the patient for escalation of symptoms is of special concem. Watch for ascending sensory loss, which precedes motor loss. Also,monitor vital signs and LOC. Assess and treat respiratory dysfunction. If respiratory muscles are weak,take serial vital capacity recordings. Use a respirometer with amouthpiece or a face mask for bedside testing.Obtain ABG measurements. Because neuromuscular disease results inprimary hypoventilation with hypoxemia and hypercapnia, watch forrespiratory failure. Be alert to signs of rising partial pressure of carbondioxide (such as confusion and tachypnea). Auscultate breath sounds, tum and position the patient, and encouragecoughing and deep breathing. Begin respiratory support at the first sign ofdyspnea or with decreasing partial pressure of arterial oxygen. Ifrespiratory failure becomes imminent, establish an emergency airwaywith an ET tube. Give meticulous skin care to prevent skin breakdown and contractures.Establish a strict tuming schedule; inspect the skin (especially sacrum,heels, and ankles) for breakdown, and reposition the patient every 2hours. After each position change, stimulate circulation by carefullymassaging pressure points. Also, use foam, gel, or altemating pressurepads at points of contact. Perform passive range-of-motion exercises within the patient s painlimits. When the patient s condition stabilizes, change to gentle stretchingand active assistance exercises. To prevent aspiration, test the gag reflex, and elevate the head of the bedbefore giving the patient anything to eat. If the gag reflex is absent, givenasogastric feedings until this reflex retums. If the patient has severeparalysis and is expected to have a long recovery period, a gastrostomytube may be necessary to provide adequate nourishment. As the patient regains strength and can tolerate a vertical position, be alertto postural hypotension. Monitor blood pressure and pulse during tiltingperiods and, if necessary, apply toe-to-groin elastic bandages to preventpostural hypotension.Inspect the patient s legs regularly for signs of thrombophlebitis(localized pain, tendemess, erythema, edema, and positive Homans sign),",21,118
435,"a common complication of Guillain-Barré syndrome. To preventthrombophlebitis, apply antiembolism stockings and give prophylacticanticoagulants, as ordered. If the patient has facial paralysis, give eye and mouth care every 4 hours. Watch for urine retention. Measure and record intake and output every 8hours, and offer the bedpan every 3 to 4 hours. Encourage adequate fluidintake of 2 qt (about 2 L) per day, unless contraindicated. If urine retentiondevelops, begin intermittent catheterization as ordered. Because theabdominal muscles are weak, the patient may need manual pressure on thebladder (Credé method) before they can urinate. To prevent or relieve constipation, offer the patient plenty of water, prunejuice, and a high-bulk diet. If necessary, give daily or altemate-daysuppositories (glycerin or bisacodyl) or enemas, as ordered. Before discharge, prepare a home care plan. Teach the patient how totransfer from bed to wheelchair, from wheelchair to toilet or tub, and howto walk short distances with a walker or a cane. Teach the family how tohelp the patient eat, compensating for facial weakness, and how to helpavoid skin breakdown. Stress the need for a regular bowel and bladderroutine. Refer the patient for physical therapy as needed. Refer the patient s family to the Guillain-Barré Syndrome Foundation Intemational.Neuromuscular Disorders MYASTHENIA GRAVISMyasthenia gravis produces sporadic but progressive weakness andabnormal fatigability of striated (skeletal) muscles, exacerbated by exerciseand repeated movement, but improved by anticholinesterase drugs. Usually,this disorder affects muscles innervated by the cranial nerves (face, lips,tongue, neck, and throat), but it can affect any muscle group. Myastheniagravis follows an unpredictable course of recurring exacerbations andperiodic remissions. There s no known cure. Drug treatment has improvedprognosis and allows patients to lead relatively normal lives except duringexacerbations. When the disease involves the respiratory system, it may belife threatening.",21,98
436,"Causes and Incidence Myasthenia gravis causes a failure in transmission of nerve impulses at theneuromuscular junction. Theoretically, such impairment may result from anautoimmune response, ineffective acetylcholine release, or inadequatemuscle fiber response to acetylcholine. (See What happens in myastheniagravis, page 197.)What Happens in Myasthenia Gravis During normal neuromuscular transmission, a motor nerve impulsetravels to a motor nerve terminal, stimulating the release of a chemicalneurotransmitter called acetylcholine. When acetylcholine diffusesacross the synapse, receptor sites in the motor end plate react anddepolarize the muscle fiber. The depolarization spreads through themuscle fiber, causing muscle contraction.In myasthenia gravis, antibodies attach to the acetylcholine receptorsites. They block, destroy, and weaken these sites, leaving theminsensitive to acetylcholine, thereby blocking neuromusculartransmission.",7,42
437,"Axon Blocked AChreceptors Vesicle containingacetylcholine (ACh)ACh ACh release site Neuromuscularjunction Motor end plateof muscle Myasthenia gravis affects 3 of every 10,000 people at any age, but it smore common in young women and older men. About 20 of neonates bomto mothers with myasthenia gravis have transient (or occasionally persistent)myasthenia. This disease may coexist with immunologic and_ thyroiddisorders; about 15 of patients with myasthenia gravis have thymomas.Remissions occur in about 25 of patients.Pathophysiology Myasthenia gravis is a breakdown of transmission across the neuromuscularjunction. The site of action is the postsynaptic membrane. It is thought thatreceptor antibodies weaken or reduce the number of acetylcholine receptorsat the neuromuscular junction reducing muscle depolarization.",5,40
438,"Complications Respiratory distress Pneumonia Chewing and swallowing difficulties Aspiration Signs and Symptoms The dominant symptoms of myasthenia gravis are skeletal muscle weaknessand fatigability. In the early stages, easy fatigability of certain muscles mayappear with no other findings. Later, it may be severe enough to causeparalysis. Typically, myasthenic muscles are strongest in the moming butweaken throughout the day, especially after exercise. Short rest periodstemporarily restore muscle function. Muscle weakness is progressive; moreand more muscles become weak, and eventually some muscles may losefunction entirely. Resulting symptoms depend on the muscle group affected;they become more intense during menses and after emotional stress,prolonged exposure to sunlight or cold, or infections.Onset may be sudden or insidious. In many patients, weak eye closure,ptosis, and diplopia are the first signs that something is wrong. Patients withmyasthenia gravis usually have blank, expressionless faces and nasal vocaltones. They experience frequent nasal regurgitation of fluids and havedifficulty chewing and swallowing. Because of this, they usually worry aboutchoking. Their eyelids droop (ptosis), and they may have to tilt their headsback to see. Their neck muscles may become too weak to support their headswithout bobbing.In patients with weakened respiratory muscles, decreased tidal volumeand vital capacity make breathing difficult and predispose to pneumonia andother respiratory tract infections. Respiratory muscle weakness (myastheniccrisis) may be severe enough to require an emergency airway and mechanicalventilation.Diagnosis Repeated muscle use over a very short time that fatigues and then improveswith rest suggests a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Tests for this neurologiccondition record the effect of exercise and subsequent rest on muscleweakness. Electromyography, with repeated neural stimulation, may help",16,98
439,"confirm this diagnosis. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies may be present inthe blood.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS The classic proof of myasthenia gravis isimproved muscle function after an I.V. injection of edrophonium omeostigmine (anticholinesterase drugs).In patients with myasthenia gravis, muscle function improves within 30 to60 seconds and lasts up to 30 minutes. Long-standing ocular muscledysfunction may fail to respond to such testing. This test can differentiate amyasthenic crisis from a cholinergic crisis (caused by acetylcholineoveractivity at the neuromuscular junction). The acetylcholine receptorantibody titer may be elevated in generalized myasthenia. Evaluation shouldtule out thyroid disease and thymoma.Treatment Treatment is symptomatic. Anticholinesterase drugs, such as neostigmine andpyridostigmine, counteract fatigue and muscle weakness and allow about80 of normal muscle function. However, these drugs become less effectiveas the disease worsens. Corticosteroids may relieve symptoms.Immunosuppressants are also used. Plasmapheresis is used in severemyasthenic exacerbation.Patients with thymomas require thymectomy, which may cause remission insome cases of adult-onset myasthenia. Acute exacerbations that cause severerespiratory distress necessitate emergency treatment. Tracheotomy, positive-pressure ventilation, and vigorous suctioning to remove secretions usuallyproduce improvement in a few days. Because anticholinesterase drugs aren teffective in myasthenic crisis, they re stopped until respiratory functionimproves. Myasthenic crisis requires immediate hospitalization and vigorousrespiratory support.Special Considerations Careful baseline assessment, early recognition and treatment of potentialcrises, supportive measures, and thorough patient teaching can minimizeexacerbations and complications. Continuity of care is essential.",16,84
440,"Establish an accurate neurologic and respiratory baseline. Thereafter,monitor tidal volume and vital capacity regularly. The patient may need aventilator and frequent suctioning to remove accumulating secretions. Be alert to signs of an impending crisis (increased muscle weakness,respiratory distress, and difficulty in talking or chewing). To prevent relapses, adhere closely to the ordered drug administrationschedule. Be prepared to give atropine for anticholinesterase overdose ortoxicity. Plan exercise, meals, patient care, and activities to make the most ofenergy peaks. For example, give medication 20 to 30 minutes beforemeals to facilitate chewing or swallowing. Allow the patient toparticipate in care.When swallowing is difficult, give soft, solid foods instead of liquids tolessen the risk of choking. Patient teaching is essential because myasthenia gravis is usually alifelong condition. Help the patient plan daily activities to coincide withenergy peaks. Stress the need for frequent rest periods throughout the day.Emphasize that periodic remissions, exacerbations, and day-to-dayfluctuations are common. Teach the patient how to recognize adverse effects and signs of toxicity ofanticholinesterase drugs (headaches, weakness, sweating, abdominalcramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive salivation, andbronchospasm) and corticosteroids (euphoria, insomnia, edema, andincreased appetite). Wam the patient to avoid strenuous exercise, stress, infection, andneedless exposure to the sun or cold. All of these things may worsen signsand symptoms.

(See Motor neuron disease, page 199.) Other motor neuron diseases includeprogressive muscular atrophy and progressive bulbar palsy. A chronic,",19,109
441,"progressively debilitating disease, ALS may be fatal in less than 1 year ormay continue for 10 years or more, depending on the muscles it affects.Motor Neuron Disease In its final stages, motor neuron disease affects both upper and lowermotor neuron cells. However, the site of initial cell damage variesaccording to the specific disease: progressive bulbar palsy. degeneration of upper motor neurons in themedulla oblongata progressive muscular atrophy: degeneration of lower motor neuronsin the spinal cord amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: degeneration of upper motor neuronsin the medulla oblongata and lower motor neurons in the spinal cord.Causes and Incidence ALS affects about 1 of 100,000 people. The exact cause of ALS is unknown,but about 10 of cases have a genetic component. In these patients, it s anautosomal dominant trait and affects men and women equally.Other than a family member affected with the hereditary form, there are noknown risk factors.Pathophysiology The principle feature in ALS is the loss of both upper and lower motomeurons. Loss of the motor neurons results in axonal degeneration andsecondary demyelination with glial proliferation and sclerosis.Complications Pneumonia Aspiration Pressure ulcers Contractures Signs and Symptoms",6,66
442,"Progressive loss of muscle strength and coordination eventually interferewith everyday activities. Patients with ALS develop fasciculations,accompanied by atrophy and weakness, especially in the muscles of the feetand the hands. Other signs include impaired speech; difficulty chewing,swallowing, and breathing; and, occasionally, choking and excessivedrooling. Mental deterioration doesn t occur, but patients may becomedepressed as a reaction to the disease.Diagnosis Characteristic clinical features indicate a combination of upper and lowermotor neuron involvement without sensory impairment. Electromyographyand muscle biopsy indicate that the motor nerves aren t functioning, yetsensory nerves are normal. CT scan and MRI may help rule out otherconditions, such as MS, spinal cord neoplasm, CNS syphilis, polyarteritis,syringomyelia, myasthenia gravis, progressive muscular dystrophy, andprogressive strokes.Treatment Management aims to control symptoms and provide emotional,psychological, and physical support. Riluzole may increase quality of lifeand survival but doesn t reverse or stop disease progression.Baclofen or diazepam helps control spasticity that interferes withactivities of daily living. Trihexyphenidyl or amitriptyline may be used forimpaired ability to swallow saliva. Gastrostomy may be needed early toprevent choking; referral to an otolaryngologist is advised. Physical therapy,rehabilitation, and use of appliances or orthopedic intervention may berequired to maximize function. Devices to assist in breathing at night ormechanical ventilation should be discussed, but the patient s wishes shouldbe respected.Special Considerations Because mental status remains intact while progressive physicaldegeneration takes place, the patient acutely perceives every change. Thisthreatens the patient s relationships, career, income, muscle coordination,sexuality, and energy.",12,104
443,"Implement a rehabilitation program designed to maintain independence foras long as possible. Help the patient obtain assistive equipment, such as a walker and awheelchair. Arrange for a visiting nurse to oversee the patient s status, toprovide support, and to teach the family about the illness.Depending on the patient s muscular capacity, assist with bathing,personal hygiene, and transfers from wheelchair to bed. Help establish aregular bowel and bladder routine. To help the patient handle increased accumulation of secretions anddysphagia, teach them how to perform self-suction. He should have asuction machine handy at home to reduce the fear of choking. To prevent skin breakdown, provide good skin care when the patient isbedridden. Tum the patient often, keep skin clean and dry, and usepressure-reducing devices such as altemating air mattress.If the patient has trouble swallowing, give soft, solid foods and positionupright during meals. Gastrostomy and nasogastric tube feedings may benecessary if the patient can no longer swallow. Teach the patient (if stillable to feed self) or family how to administer gastrostomy feedings. Provide emotional support. A discussion of directives regardinghealthcare decisions should be instituted before the patient becomesunable to communicate his or her wishes. Prepare the patient and familymembers for eventual death, and encourage the start of the grievingprocess. Patients with ALS may benefit from a hospice program or thelocal ALS support group chapter.MULTIPLE SCLEROSISMS is a progressive disease caused by demyelination of the white matter ofthe brain and spinal cord. (See Understanding myelin breakdown, page201.) In this disease, sporadic patches of demyelination throughout the CNSinduce widely disseminated and varied neurologic dysfunction.Characterized by exacerbations and remissions, MS is a major cause ofchronic disability in young adults.Understanding Myelin Breakdown",16,105
444,"Myelin plays a key role in speeding electrical impulses to the brain forinterpretation. The myelin sheath is a lipoprotein complex formed of glialcells. It protects the neuron s long nerve fiber (axon) much like theinsulation on an electrical wire. Because of its high electrical resistanceand weak ability to store an electrical charge, the myelin sheath permitsconduction of nerve impulses from one node of Ranvier to the next.Effects of Injury Myelin can be injured by hypoxemia, toxic chemicals, vascularinsufficiency, or autoimmune responses. When this occurs, the myelinsheath becomes inflamed and the membrane layers break down intosmaller components. These components become well-circumscribedplaques filled with microglial elements, macroglia, and lymphocytes.This process is called demyelination.The damaged myelin sheath impairs normal conduction, causing partialloss or dispersion of the action potential and consequent neurologicdysfunction.",6,52
445,"Dendrites Cell body Nucleus Axon Myelin sheath Plaque Nodes of Ranvier Demyelination Axon terminals The prognosis varies; MS may progress rapidly, disabling some patientsby early adulthood or causing death within months of onset. However, 70 of patients lead active, productive lives with prolonged remissions.Causes and Incidence The exact cause of MS is unknown, but current theories suggest a slow-actingor latent viral infection and an autoimmune response. Other theories suggestthat environmental and genetic factors may also be linked to MS. Emotional",4,33
446,"stress, overwork, fatigue, pregnancy, and acute respiratory tract infectionshave been known to precede the onset of this illness.MS usually begins between 20 and 40 years old. It affects more womenthan men. A family history of MS and living in a geographical area with ahigher incidence of MS (northem Europe, northem United States, southem Australia, and New Zealand) increase the risk.Pathophysiology There is sporadic patchy axon demyelination and nerve fiber loss throughoutthe CNS. Loss of the myelin sheath disrupts nerve conduction withsubsequent neuronal death and atrophy.Complications Injuries from falls Urinary tract infections Constipation Joint contractures Pressure ulcers Rectal distention Pneumonia Signs and Symptoms Clinical findings in MS depend on the extent and site of myelin destruction,the extent of remyelination, and the adequacy of subsequent restored synaptictransmission.Signs and symptoms in MS may be transient, or they may last for hours orweeks. They may wax and wane with no predictable pattem, vary from dayto day, and be bizarre and difficult for the patient to describe.In most patients, visual problems and sensory impairment, such asnumbness and tingling sensations (paresthesia), are the first signs thatsomething may be wrong.Other characteristic changes include: ocular disturbances optic neuritis, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, blurredvision, and nystagmus muscle dysfunction weakness, paralysis ranging from monoplegia toquadriplegia, spasticity, hyperreflexia, intention tremor, and gait ataxia",5,87
447,"urinary disturbances incontinence, frequency, urgency, and frequentinfections emotional lability characteristic mood swings, irritability, euphoria,and depression.Associated signs and symptoms include poorly articulated or scanningspeech and dysphagia. Clinical effects may be so mild that the patient isunaware of them or so bizarre that they appear hysterical.Diagnosis A misdiagnosis of psychiatric problems is common. Because early symptomsmay be mild, years may elapse between onset of the first signs and thediagnosis, which typically requires evidence of multiple neurologic attacksand characteristic remissions and exacerbations. MRI may detect MSlesions; however, diagnosis still remains difficult. Periodic testing and closeobservation of the patient are necessary, perhaps for years, depending on thecourse of the disease.Abnormal EEG findings occur in one third of patients. Lumbar punctureshows elevated gamma globulin fraction of immunoglobulin G but normaltotal CSF protein levels. Elevated CSF gamma globulin is significant onlywhen serum gamma globulin levels are normal because it reflectshyperactivity of the immune system due to chronic demyelination.Oligoclonal bands of immunoglobulin can be detected when gamma globulinin CSF is examined by electrophoresis, and these bands are present in mostpatients, even when the percentage of gamma globulin in CSF is normal. Inaddition, the white blood cell count in CSF may rise. Differential diagnosismust rule out spinal cord compression, foramen magnum tumor (may mimicthe exacerbations and remissions of MS), multiple small strokes, syphilis orother infection, and psychological disturbances.Treatment The aim of treatment is to shorten exacerbations and relieve neurologicdeficits so that the patient can resume a normal lifestyle. Those withrelapsing remitting courses are placed on immune modulating therapy, withinterferon or glatiramer acetate. Steroids are used to reduce the associatededema of the myelin sheath during exacerbations.",11,99
448,"Other drugs include baclofen, tizanidine, or diazepam to relieve spasticity;cholinergic agents to relieve urine retention and minimize frequency andurgency; amantadine to relieve fatigue; and antidepressants to help withmood or behavioral symptoms. During acute exacerbations, supportivemeasures include bed rest, comfort measures such as massages, prevention offatigue, prevention of pressure ulcers, bowel and bladder training (ifnecessary), administration of antibiotics for bladder infections, physicaltherapy, and counseling. Physical therapy, speech therapy, occupationaltherapy, and support groups are also useful. Planned exercise programs helpwith maintaining muscle tone.Special Considerations Management considerations focus on educating the patient and family. Assist with physical therapy. Increase patient comfort with massages andrelaxing baths. Assist with active, resistive, and stretching exercises tomaintain muscle tone and joint mobility, decrease spasticity, improvecoordination, and boost morale. Educate the patient and family conceming the chronic course of MS.Emphasize the need to avoid temperature extremes, stress, fatigue, andinfections and other illnesses, all of which can trigger an MS attack.Advise the patient to maintain independence by developing new ways ofperforming daily activities. Stress the importance of eating a nutritious, well-balanced diet thatcontains sufficient roughage and adequate fluids to prevent constipation. Evaluate the need for bowel and bladder training during hospitalization.Encourage adequate fluid intake and regular urination. Eventually, thepatient may require urinary drainage by self-catheterization or, in men,condom drainage. Teach the correct use of suppositories to help establisha regular bowel schedule. Promote emotional stability. Help the patient establish a daily routine tomaintain optimal functioning. Activity level is regulated by tolerancelevel. Encourage regular rest periods to prevent fatigue and daily physicalexercise. Inform the patient that exacerbations are unpredictable, necessitatingphysical and emotional adjustments in lifestyle.",17,122

It can subside spontaneously, and remissions may last fromseveral months to years.Causes and Incidence Although the cause remains undetermined, trigeminal neuralgia may reflect anafferent reflex in the brainstem or in the sensory root of the trigeminal nerve.Such neuralgia may also be related to compression of the nerve root byposterior fossa tumors, middle fossa tumors, or vascular lesions (subclinicalaneurysm), although such lesions usually produce simultaneous loss ofsensation. Occasionally, trigeminal neuralgia is a manifestation of MS orherpes zoster. Regardless of the cause, the pain of trigeminal neuralgia isprobably produced by an interaction or short-circuiting of touch and painfibers.Trigeminal neuralgia occurs mostly in people older than 40, in womenmore commonly than in men, and on the right side of the face more commonlythan on the left. The incidence is 4 to 5 cases per 100,000 people.Pathophysiology The exact pathophysiology of trigeminal neuralgia is controversial. It can beeither centrally mediated or peripherally mediated. The trigeminal nerveitself can cause the pain as its major function is sensory. There is also abelief that the pain is mediated by vascular compression of the nerve but in85 of people there is no structural lesion. Microanatomic small and largefiber demyelination is often seen at the root entry zone. There is a lack ofinhibitory inputs and a re-entry mechanism causes an amplification ofsensory inputs.",10,84
450,"Complications Double vision Jaw weakness Loss of comeal reflex Malnutrition Numbness of face Signs and Symptoms Typically, the patient reports a searing or buming pain that occurs in lightninglike jabs and lasts from to 15 minutes (usually 1 to 2 minutes) in an areainnervated by one of the divisions of the trigeminal nerve, primarily thesuperior mandibular or maxillary division. The pain rarely affects more thanone division and seldom the first division (ophthalmic) or both sides of theface. It affects the second (maxillary) and third (mandibular) divisions of thetrigeminal nerve equally. (See Trigeminal nerve function and distribution.)Trigeminal Nerve Function and Distribution Function Motor: chewing movements Sensory: sensations of face, scalp, and teeth (mouth and nasalchamber)Distribution1. Ophthalmic2. Maxillary3. Mandibular",8,38
451,"These attacks characteristically follow stimulation of a trigger zone,usually by a light touch to a hypersensitive area, such as the tip of the nose,the cheeks, or the gums. Although attacks can occur at any time, they mayfollow a draft of air, exposure to heat or cold, eating, smiling, talking, ordrinking hot or cold beverages. The frequency of attacks varies greatly, frommany times a day to several times a month or year. Between attacks, mostpatients are free from pain, although some have a constant, dull ache. Nopatient is ever free from the fear of the next attack.Diagnosis The patient s pain history is the basis for diagnosis because trigeminalneuralgia produces no objective clinical or pathologic changes. Physicalexamination shows no impairment of sensory or motor function; indeed,sensory impairment implies a space-occupying lesion as the cause of pain.Observation during the examination shows the patient favoring (splinting)the affected area. To ward off a painful attack, the patient commonly holdsthe face immobile when talking. The patient may also leave the affected sideof the face unwashed and unshaven or protect it with a coat or shawl. When",9,69
452,"asked where the pain occurs, the patient points to but never touches theaffected area. Witnessing a typical attack helps to confirm diagnosis. Rarely,a tumor in the posterior fossa can produce pain that s clinicallyindistinguishable from trigeminal neuralgia. Skull X-rays, CT scan, and MRIrule out sinus or tooth infections and tumors. If the patient has trigeminalneuralgia, these test results are normal.Treatment Oral administration of carbamazepine (Tegretol), gabapentin (Neurontin), orphenytoin may temporarily relieve or prevent pain. Opioids are of little helpduring the pain episode. Caution should be used when treating a chronicproblem with opioids.When these medical measures fail or attacks become increasingly frequentor severe, neurosurgical procedures may provide permanent relief. Thepreferred procedure is percutaneous electrocoagulation of nerve rootletsunder a local anesthetic. Other treatments include a percutaneous radiofrequency procedure, which causes partial root destruction and relieves pain,and microsurgery for vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve.Gamma knife radiosurgery, the least invasive procedure, can be done forpatients refractory to medications or patients who have multiple medicalcomorbidities.Special Considerations The focus here is management of pain. Observe and record the characteristics of each attack, including thepatient s protective mechanisms. Provide adequate nutrition in small, frequent meals served at roomtemperature. Avoid jarring the bed and causing increased discomfort.If the patient is receiving neuroleptics, watch for cutaneous andhematologic reactions (erythematous and pruritic rashes, urticaria,photosensitivity, exfoliative dermatitis, leukopenia, agranulocytosis,eosinophilia, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia) and, possibly, urineretention and transient drowsiness. For the first 3 months of therapy,monitor CBC and liver function weekly, then monthly thereafter. Wam thepatient to immediately report fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers, easy",14,105
453,"bruising, or petechial or purpuric hemorrhage because these may signalthrombocytopenia or aplastic anemia and may require discontinuation ofdrug therapy.If the patient is receiving phenytoin, also watch for adverse effects,including ataxia, skin eruptions, gingival hyperplasia, and nystagmus. After resection of the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, tell the patientto avoid rubbing their eyes and using aerosol spray. Advise the patient towear glasses or goggles outdoors and to blink often. After surgery to sever the second or third branch, tell the patient to avoidhot foods and drinks, which could bum the mouth, and to chew carefullyto avoid biting the mouth. The patient may need to eat pureed food,possibly through a straw. Advise the patient to place food in theunaffected side of the mouth when chewing, to brush teeth and rinse themouth often, and to see the dentist twice a year to detect cavities becausethey won t experience pain from cavities in the area of the severed nerve. After surgical decompression of the root or partial nerve dissection,check neurologic and vital signs often. Provide emotional support, and encourage the patient to express theirfeelings. Promote independence through self-care and maximum physicalactivity. Reinforce natural avoidance of stimulation (air, heat, and cold) oftrigger zones (lips, cheeks, and gums).BELL PALSYBell palsy is a disease of the seventh cranial nerve (facial) that producesunilateral or bilateral facial weakness or paralysis. (See Recognizingunilateral Bell palsy.) Onset is rapid. In 80 to 90 of patients, Bell palsysubsides spontaneously, with complete recovery in to 8 weeks; however,recovery may be delayed in the elderly. If recovery is partial, contracturesmay develop on the paralyzed side of the face. Bell palsy may recur on thesame or opposite side of the face.Recognizing Unilateral Bell Palsy Bell palsy usually causes a unilateral facial paralysis. This produces adistorted appearance with an inability to wrinkle the forehead, close theeyelid, smile, show the teeth, or puff out the cheek.",16,113
454,Distorted appearance Smiling,1,3
455,"Causes and incidence Bell palsy blocks the seventh cranial nerve, which is responsible for motorinnervation of the muscles of the face. The conduction block is from aninflammatory reaction around the nerve (usually at the intemal auditorymeatus), which may result from infection, hemorrhage, tumor, meningitis,local trauma, hypertension, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, or infarction of thenerve.Bell palsy affects all age groups and males and females nearly equally,although females are slightly more likely to develop it during their late teensand early 20s. In the United States, the incidence is 23 cases per 100,000people.Pathophysiology Bell palsy is thought to occur related to inflammation of the seventh cranialnerve; pressure is produced where the nerve exits the skull through a bonyforamen blocking the transmission of the nerve impulse.Complications Comeal ulcers Blindness Impaired nutrition",3,45
456,"Signs and symptoms Bell palsy usually produces unilateral facial weakness, occasionally withaching pain around the angle of the jaw or behind the ear. On the weak side,the mouth droops (causing the patient to drool saliva from the comer of themouth), and taste perception is distorted over the affected anterior portion ofthe tongue. The forehead appears smooth, and the patient s ability to close hiseye on the weak side is markedly impaired. When the patient tries to closethis eye, it rolls upward (Bell phenomenon) and shows excessive tearing.Although Bell phenomenon occurs in normal people, it isn t apparentbecause the eyelids close completely and cover this eye motion. In Bellpalsy, incomplete eye closure makes this upward motion obvious. Othersymptoms may include loss of taste and ringing in the ear.Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation: distorted facial appearance andthe inability to raise the eyebrow, close the eyelid, smile, show the teeth, orpuff out the cheek. Electromyography helps determine the severity of nervedamage. Blood tests may be done to rule out acute causes (sarcoidosis or Lyme disease). If no improvement is evident within several weeks of onset,MRI will rule out other causes of dysfunction.Treatment Treatment consists of corticosteroids to reduce facial nerve edema andimprove nerve conduction and blood flow. They must be given early within24 hours of onset of paralysis to be most effective. Lubricants or an eyeointment may be needed to protect the eye, as well as patching during sleep.Special considerations Patient care includes observation for adverse drug effects, pain relief, andemotional support. During treatment with corticosteroids, watch for adverse effects, such as Gl distress and fluid retention. If GI distress is troublesome, aconcomitant antacid usually provides relief. If the patient has diabetes,frequent monitoring of serum glucose levels is necessary. To reduce pain, apply moist heat to the affected side of the face, takingcare not to bum the skin.",15,112
457,"To help maintain muscle tone, massage the patient s face with a gentleupward motion two to three times daily for 5 to 10 minutes, or have thepatient massage the face himself. When the patient is ready for activeexercises, teach how to exercise by grimacing in front of a mirror. Advise the patient to protect the eye by covering it with an eye patch,especially when outdoors. Tell the patient to keep warm and avoidexposure to dust and wind. When exposure is unavoidable, instruct thepatient to cover the face.Instruct the patient to chew on the unaffected side of the mouth. Provide asoft, nutritionally balanced diet, eliminating hot foods and fluids. Give thepatient frequent mouth care, being particularly careful to remove residualfood that collects between the cheeks and gums. Offer psychological support.PERIPHERAL NEURITISPeripheral neuritis (also called multiple neuritis, peripheral neuropathy,and polyneuritis) is the degeneration of peripheral nerves supplying mainlythe distal muscles of the extremities. It results in muscle weakness withsensory loss and atrophy and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes. Thissyndrome is associated with a noninflammatory degeneration of the axon andmyelin sheaths, chiefly affecting the distal muscles of the extremities.Because onset is usually insidious, patients may compensate by overusingunaffected muscles. If the cause can be identified and eliminated, theprognosis is good.Causes and incidence Causes of peripheral neuritis include: hereditary disorders (Charcot-Marie Tooth disease or Friedreich ataxia) exposure to toxic compounds (sniffing glue or toxic compounds, nitrousoxide, industrial agents especially solvents, and heavy metals, such aslead, arsenic, or mercury) infectious or inflammatory diseases (acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome, botulism, Colorado tick fever, hepatitis, humanimmunodeficiency virus infection, leprosy, rheumatoid arthritis,sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diphtheria, syphilis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome)",11,102
458,"systemic or metabolic disorders (diabetes mellitus, dietary deficiencies especially B,, , excessive use of alcohol, uremia, and cancer) neuropathy secondary to drugs miscellaneous causes (ischemia and prolonged exposure to coldtemperature).Peripheral neuropathy is common. Risk factors include diabetes, heavyalcohol use, and exposure to certain drugs and chemicals. Prolongedpressure ona nerve (such as with a cast, splint, or other device) is also a riskfactor for developing nerve injury. Although it can occur at any age,incidence is highest in men between 30 and 50 years old.Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of peripheral neuritis is unclear. However, evidencesuggests that the manifestation is related to an increased number of sodiumchannels or an abnormal sodium channel subtype in the injured nerve creating abnormal nerve activity.Complications Impotence Difficulty breathing Dysphagia Signs and symptoms The clinical effects of peripheral neuritis develop slowly, and the diseaseusually affects the motor and sensory nerve fibers. Symptoms vary accordingto which type of nerve is affected (sensory, motor, or autonomic). Neuropathycan affect any one or be a combination of all three types.Sensory changes: Damage to sensory fibers results in changes insensation, ranging from abnormal sensations, such as buming, nerve pain,or tingling, to numbness or an inability to determine joint position in thearea. Sensation changes often begin in the feet and progress toward thecenter of the body with involvement of other areas as the conditionworsens. Motor changes: Damage to the motor fibers interferes with musclecontrol and can cause weakness, loss of muscle bulk, and loss of",9,90
459,"dexterity. Muscle cramping may be a sign of motor nerve involvement.Other muscle-related symptoms include lack of muscle control, difficultyor inability to move a part of the body (paralysis), muscle atrophy, muscletwitching (fasciculation) or cramping, difficulty breathing or swallowing,falling (from legs buckling or tripping over toes), or lack of dexterity(such as the inability to button a shirt). Autonomic changes: The autonomic nerves control involuntary or semi-voluntary functions, such as control of intemal organs and blood pressure.Damage to autonomic nerves can cause blurred vision, decreased abilityto sweat (anhidrosis), dizziness that occurs when standing up or faintingassociated with a fall in blood pressure, heat intolerance with exertion(decreased ability to regulate body temperature), nausea or vomiting aftermeals, abdominal bloating (swelling), feeling full after eating a smallamount (early satiety), diarrhea, constipation, unintentional weight loss(more than 5 of body weight), urinary incontinence, feeling ofincomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate (urinaryhesitancy), and male impotence.Diagnosis Patient history and physical examination delineate characteristic distributionof motor and sensory deficits. Electromyography may show a delayed actionpotential if this condition impairs motor nerve function. Nerve biopsy andnerve conduction tests can facilitate diagnosis.Treatment Effective treatment of peripheral neuritis consists of supportive measures torelieve pain, adequate bed rest, and physical therapy, vocational therapy,occupational therapy, and orthopedic interventions to promote independence,as needed. Most importantly, however, the underlying cause must beidentified and corrected. For instance, it s essential to identify and removethe toxic agent, correct nutritional and vitamin deficiencies (the patient needsa high-calorie diet rich in vitamins, especially B-complex), and counsel thepatient to avoid alcohol.Over-the-counter analgesics or prescription pain medications may beneeded to control nerve pain. Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine,and gabapentin) or tricyclic antidepressants may be used to reduce the",8,112
460,"stabbing pains that some patients experience. Whenever possible, medicationuse should be minimized to avoid adverse effects.Fludrocortisone or similar medications may be beneficial in reducingpostural hypotension for some patients. Medications that increase gastricmotility, such as metoclopramide, are helpful for patients with reducedgastric motility.For patients with bladder dysfunction, manual expression of urine(pressing over the bladder with the hands), intermittent catheterization, ormedications such as bethanechol may be necessary.Special considerations Patient care includes promoting maximal independence and control ofsymptoms. Exercises and retraining may be used to increase muscle strength andcontrol. Appliances, such as wheelchairs, braces, and splints, mayimprove mobility or the ability to use an affected extremity. The patient with decreased sensation should be taught to check feet orother affected areas frequently for bruises, open skin areas, or otherinjuries. A podiatrist can usually determine whether special orthoticdevices are needed. Discuss safety measures in the home. Safety measures for the patientexperiencing difficulty with movement may include railings, specializedappliances, removal of obstacles (such as loose rugs that may slip on thefloor), and other measures, as appropriate. Safety measures for the patientwith diminished sensation include adequate lighting (including lights lefton at night), testing water temperature before bathing or immersing thebody in water, and the use of protective shoes (no open toes and no highheels). Shoes should be checked often for grit or rough spots that maycause injury to the feet. The patient with neuropathy (especially the patient with polyneuropathy ormononeuropathy multiplex) is prone to new nerve injury at pressurepoints, such as the knees and elbows. Caution the patient to avoidprolonged pressure on these areas from leaning on the elbows, crossingthe knees, or similar positions. Advise the patient with orthostatic hypotension to use elastic stockingsand sleep with the head elevated.",14,108
461,"Instruct the patient with reduced gastric motility to eat small, frequentmeals and sleep with the head elevated. Assist the patient with bladder dysfunction with manual expression ofurine and intermittent catheterization, as necessary. To prevent pressure ulcers, assist in tuming and repositioning every 2hours and apply a food cradle. To prevent contractures, provide range-of-motion exercises as well as arrange for the patient to obtain splints,boards, braces, or other orthopedic appliances. Suggest that the patient s family contact the Neuropathy Association foradditional information.Pain disorders COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROMEComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), also known as reflex sympatheticdystrophy (CRPS1) or causalgia (CRPS2), is a chronic pain disorder thatresults from abnormal healing after an injury either minor or major to abone, muscle, or nerve. The development of symptoms is commonlydisproportionate to the severity of the injury and seems to result fromabnormal functioning of the sympathetic nervous system, the part of thenervous system that controls the diameter of blood vessels. One or morelimbs and other parts of the body may be affected.Causes and incidence The exact cause of CRPS is unknown. Impaired communication between thedamaged nerves of the sympathetic nervous system and the brain may causeinterference with normal signals for sensations, temperature, and blood flow.This leads to problems in the nerves, blood vessels, skin, bones, andmuscles. Infection or injury to an arm or leg may initiate CRPS. It can alsooccur after heart attacks and strokes. However, the condition can sometimesappear without obvious injury to the affected limb. This condition is morecommon in people between 40 and 60 years old but has been seen in youngerpeople too. CRPS may also be seen in postoperative patients and in patientswith diseases that can cause chronic pain, such as cancer and arthritis. Theannual incidence is unknown because CRPS is often misdiagnosed.",14,106
462,"However, it has been reported in 1 to 2 of patients with various fracturesand in 2 to 5 of patients with peripheral nerve injury.Pathophysiology The exact mechanism of CRPS is not well understood. Research suggests thatit is multifactorial involving both sympathetic and central fibers, resulting inperipheral and central sensitization, inflammation and altered sympatheticand catecholinergic function and psychophysiologic functions.Complications Depression Drug dependence Signs and symptoms Patients usually report severe and constant pain; severe pain is common with CRPS2 in particular. The affected area may have altered blood flow, feelingeither warm or cool to the touch, with discoloration, sweating, or swelling.In time, skin, hair, and nail changes may occur along with impaired mobilityand muscle wasting, especially if adequate treatment is delayed.Diagnosis There s no laboratory test for CRPS, so the diagnosis is based on thepatient s history and clinical findings. A history of injury to an extremity maypoint to CRPS. Bone X-rays may aid in ruling out other conditions, such asosteomyelitis and stress fractures, which cause similar signs and symptoms.Additional tests may include bone scans, nerve conduction studies, andthermography (a test to show temperature changes and lack of blood supplyin the painful area of the affected limb). With early diagnosis, prognosisimproves.Treatment Treatment typically includes a combination of therapies such as drug therapy,with an anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, vasodilator, and analgesic usedsingly or in varying combinations, depending on the patient and the severityof symptoms. Steroids may be given in some patients; others may be givenbone loss medications such as Actonel. Physical therapy to the injured area,",8,90
463,"application of heat and cold, the use of a transcutaneous electrical nervestimulator unit, biofeedback, and psychological support are helpful for somepatients.Treatment may also include techniques for interrupting the hyperactivity ofthe sympathetic nervous system, such as nerve or regional blocks. Surgicalsympathectomy tradical surgery that involves cutting the nerves to destroythe pain may be done in severe cases; however, this method is rarely usedbecause other sensation may be destroyed in the process.Special considerations Offer emotional support to the patient and the family. Teach them about thedisease.Monitor effects of prescribed medications. In addition to attending physical therapy sessions, the patient may need ahome therapy regimen that includes stretching, active and passiveexercises, strengthening exercises, compressive stockings or gloves tocontrol edema, and heat or cold pack applications. Consult a pain care specialist to provide additional options for thepatient, and help manage discomfort. Because chronic pain can be an emotional burden to the patient and thefamily, provide information on resources, such as counseling, supportgroups, stress reduction methods, meditation, relaxation training, andhypnosis.SELECTED REFERENCESBalami, J.

842,"macrophages.The immune response primarily involves the interaction of lymphocytes (Tand B cells), macrophages, and macrophage-like cells and their products.These cells may be circulating or may be localized in the immune system stissues and organs, including the thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils.The thymus participates in the maturation of T lymphocytes (cell-mediatedimmunity); here these cells are educated to differentiate self from nonself. In contrast, B lymphocytes (humoral immunity) mature in the bonemarrow. The key humoral effector mechanism is the production ofimmunoglobulin (Ig) by B cells and the subsequent activation of thecomplement cascade. The lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and intestinal lymphoidtissue help remove and destroy circulating antigens in the blood and lymph.ANTIGENSAn antigen is any substance that can induce an immune response. T and Blymphocytes have specific receptors that respond to specific antigenmolecular shapes (epitopes). In B lymphocytes, or B cells, this receptor is an Ig (antibody) cell: Ig D or Ig M, sometimes referred to as a surface Ig. The T-cell antigen receptor recognizes antigens only in association with specificcell-surface molecules known as the major histocompatibility complex(MHC). (See The major histocompatibility complex, page 381.) MHCmolecules, which differ among individuals, identify substances as self omonself. Slightly different antigen receptors can recognize a phenomenalnumber of distinct antigens, which are coded by distinct, variable regiongenes.The major histocompatibility complex The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a cluster of genes onhuman chromosome 6 that plays a pivotal role in the immune response.Also known as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, these genes areinherited in an autosomal codominant manner. That is, each individualreceives one set of MHC genes (haplotype) from each parent, and bothsets of genes are expressed on the individual s cells. These genes play arole in the recognition of self versus nonself and in the interaction ofimmunologically active cells by coding for cell-surface proteins.",12,98
843,"HLA genes are divided into three classes. Class I molecules appear onthe surface of nearly all of the body s cells and include HLA-A, HLA-B,and HLA-C genes. During tissue graft rejection, they re the chief antigensrecognized by the host. When killer (CD8 ) T cells detect a virallyinfected antigen, they recognize it in the context of a class I molecule.Class II molecules only appear on B cells, macrophages, and activated Tcells. They include the HLA-D and HLA-DR genes. Class II moleculespromote efficient collaboration between immunocompetent cells.Helper (CD4 ) T cells require that antigen be presented in the contextof a class II molecule. Because these molecules also determine whetheran individual responds to a particular antigen, they re also known asimmune response genes. Class II molecules include certain complementproteins (C2, C4, and Factor B).Groups, or clones, of lymphocytes exist with identical receptors for aspecific antigen. The clone of a lymphocyte rapidly proliferates whenexposed to the specific antigen. Some lymphocytes further differentiate, andothers become memory cells, which allow a more rapid response thememory or anamnestic response to subsequent challenge by the antigen.Many factors influence antigenicity. Among them are the antigen s physicaland chemical characteristics, its relative foreignness, and the individual sgenetic makeup, particularly the MHC molecules. Most antigens are largemolecules, such as proteins or polysaccharides. (Smaller molecules such asdrugs that aren t antigenic by themselves are known as haptens. Thesehaptens can bind with larger molecules, or carriers, and become antigenic orimmunogenic.) The antigen s relative foreignness influences the immuneresponse s intensity. For example, little or no immune response may followtransfusion of serum proteins between humans; however, a vigorous immuneresponse (serum sickness) commonly follows transfusion of horse serumproteins to a human. Genetic makeup may also determine why someindividuals respond to certain antigens, whereas others don t. The genesresponsible for this phenomenon encode the MHC molecules.B LYMPHOCYTESB lymphocytes and their products, Igs, contribute to humoral immunity. Thebinding of soluble antigen with B-cell antigen receptors initiates the humoral",18,115
844,"immune response. The activated B cells differentiate into plasma cells thatsecrete Igs or antibodies. This response is regulated by T lymphocytes andtheir products, lymphokines. These lymphokines, which include interleukin(IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, and interferon (IFN) gamma, are important in determiningthe class of Igs made by B cells.The Igs secreted by plasma cells are four-chain molecules with two heavy(H) and two light (L) chains. (See Structure of the immunoglobulinmolecule, page 382.) Each chain has a variable (V) region and one or moreconstant (C) regions, which are coded by separate genes. The V regions ofboth L and H chains participate in the binding of antigens. The C regions ofthe H chain provide a binding site for crystallizable fragment (Fc) receptorson cells and govem other mechanisms.Structure of the immunoglobulin molecule The immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule consists of four polypeptide chains two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains held together by disulfidebonds. The H chain has one variable (V) and at least three constant (C)regions. The L chain has one V and one C regions. Together, the Vregions of the H and L chains form a pocket known as the antigen-bindingsite. This site is located within the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) regionof the molecule. Part of the C region of the H chains forms thecrystallizable fragment (Fc) region of the molecule. This region mediateseffector mechanisms such as complement activation and is the portion ofthe Ig molecule bound by Fc receptors on phagocytic cells, mast cells,and basophils. Each Ig molecule also has two antibody-combining sites(except for the Ig M molecule, which has 10, and Ig A, which may havetwo or more).",15,78
845,"Heavy chain Antigen-bindingsite Light chainae Fab region Disulfide bonds Fc region Any clone of B lymphocytes has one antigen specificity determined by the V regions of its L and H chains. However, the clone can change the class of Ig that it makes by changing the association between its V region genes and Hchain C region genes (a process known as isotype switching). For example,a clone of B lymphocytes genetically preprogrammed to recognize tetanustoxoid initially will make an Ig M antibody against tetanus toxoid and later an Ig G or other antibody against it.The five known classes of Igs Ig G, Ig M, Ig A, Ig E, and Ig D aredistinguished by the constant portions of their H chains. However, each classhas a kappa or a lambda L chain, which gives rise to many subtypes. Thealmost limitless combinations of L and H chains give Igs their specificity. Ig G, the smallest Ig, appears in all body fluids because of its ability tomove across membranes as a single structural unit (a monomer). Itconstitutes 75 of total serum Igs and is the major antibacterial andantiviral antibody. Ig M, the largest Ig, appears as a pentamer (five monomers joined by a J-chain). Unlike Ig G which is produced mainly in the secondary, or recall,response Ig M dominates in the primary, or initial, immune response.",9,67
846,"However, like Ig G, Ig M is involved in classic antibody reactions,including precipitation, agglutination, neutralization, and complementfixation. Because of its size, Ig M can t readily cross membrane barriersand is usually present only in the vascular system. Ig M constitutes 5 oftotal serum Igs. Ig A exists in serum primarily as a monomer; in secretory form, Ig A existsalmost exclusively as a dimer (two monomer molecules joined by a J-chain and a secretory component chain). As a secretory Ig, Ig A defendsextemal body surfaces and is present in colostrum, saliva, tears, nasalfluids, and respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), and genitourinary (GU)secretions. This antibody is considered important in preventing antigenicagents from attaching to epithelial surfaces. Ig A makes up 20 of totalserum Igs. Ig E, present in trace amounts in serum, is involved in the release ofvasoactive amines stored in basophils and tissue mast cell granules. Whenreleased, these bioamines cause the allergic effects characteristic of thistype of hypersensitivity (erythema, itching, smooth-muscle contraction,secretions, and swelling). Ig D, present as a monomer in serum in minute amounts, is the predominantantibody found on the surface of B lymphocytes and serves mainly as anantigen receptor. It may function in controlling lymphocyte activation orsuppression.T LYMPHOCYTEST lymphocytes, or T cells, and macrophages are the chief participants in cell-mediated immunity. Immature T lymphocytes are derived from the bonemarrow. Upon migration to the thymus, they undergo a maturation processthat depends on the HLA genes. Thus, mature T cells can distinguish betweenself and nonself. T cells acquire certain surface molecules, or markers; thesemarkers combined with the T-cell antigen receptor promote the particularactivation of each type of T cell. T-cell activation requires presentation ofantigens in the context of a specific HLA gene. Helper T cells require class IIHLA genes; cytotoxic T cells require class I HLA genes. T-cell activationalso involves IL-1, produced by macrophages, and IL-2, produced by Tcells.Natural killer (NK) cells are a discrete population of large lymphocytes,some of which resemble T lymphocytes. NK cells recognize surface changes",19,117
847,"on body cells infected with a virus; they then bind to and, in many cases, killthe infected cells.MACROPHAGESImportant cells of the reticuloendothelial system, macrophages influence bothimmune and inflammatory responses. Macrophage precursors circulate in theblood. When they collect in various tissues and organs, they differentiate intomacrophages with varying characteristics. Unlike B and T lymphocytes,macrophages lack surface receptors for specific antigens; instead, they havereceptors for the C region of the H chain (Fc region) of Ig, for fragments ofthe third component of complement (C3), and for nonimmunologic factorssuch as carbohydrate molecules.One of the most important functions of macrophages is the presentation ofantigen to T lymphocytes. Macrophages ingest and process antigen, thendeposit it on their own surfaces in association with HLA gene. Tlymphocytes become activated upon recognizing this complex. Macrophagesalso function in the inflammatory response by producing IL-1, whichgenerates fever. Additionally, macrophages synthesize complement proteinsand other mediators that produce phagocytic, microbicidal, and tumoricidaleffects.CYTOKINESCytokines are low molecular-weight proteins involved in communicationbetween cells. Their purpose is to induce or regulate a variety of immune orinflammatory responses. However, disorders may occur if cytokineproduction or regulation is impaired. Cytokines are categorized as follows: Colony-stimulating factors function primarily as hematopoietic growthfactors, guiding the division and differentiation of bone marrow stemcells. They also influence the functioning of mature lymphocytes,monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Interferons act early to limit the spread of viral infections. They alsoinhibit tumor growth. Mainly, they determine how well tissue cellsinteract with cytotoxic cells and lymphocytes. Interleukins are a large group of cytokines. (Those produced primarily by T lymphocytes are called lymphokines. Those produced by mononuclear",18,95
848,"phagocytes are called monokines.) They have a variety of effects, butmost direct other cells to divide and differentiate. Tumor necrosis factor is believed to play a major role in mediatinginflammation and cytotoxic reactions (along with IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8). Transforming growth factor demonstrates both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects. It s believed to be partially responsible for tissuefibrosis associated with many diseases. It demonstratesimmunosuppressive effects on T cells, B cells, and NK cells.COMPLEMENT SYSTEMThe chief humoral effector of the inflammatory response, the complementsystem consists of more than 20 serum proteins that are synthesized primarilyin the liver. When activated, these proteins interact in a cascadelike processthat has profound biologic effects. Complement activation takes placethrough one of two pathways. In the classical pathway, binding of Ig M or Ig Gand antigen forms antigen antibody complexes that activate the firstcomplement component, C1. This, in tum, activates C4, C2, and C3. In thealtemative pathway, activating surfaces such as bacterial membranes directlyamplify spontaneous cleavage of C3. Once C3 is activated in either pathway,activation of the terminal components C5 to C9 follows.The major biologic effects of complement activation include phagocyteattraction (chemotaxis) and activation, histamine release, viral neutralization,promotion of phagocytosis by opsonization, and lysis of cells and bacteria.Other mediators of inflammation derived from the kinin and coagulationpathways interact with the complement system.POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTESBesides macrophages and complement, other key participants in theinflammatory response are the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (also known asgranulocytes ) neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.Neutrophils, the most numerous of these cells, derive from bone marrowand increase dramatically in number in response to infection andinflammation. Highly mobile cells, neutrophils are attracted to areas ofinflammation (chemotaxis); in fact, they re the primary constituent of pus.Neutrophils have surface receptors for Ig and complement fragments, andthey avidly ingest opsonized particles such as bacteria. Ingested organisms",14,110
849,"are then promptly killed by toxic oxygen metabolites and enzymes such aslysozyme. Unfortunately, neutrophils not only kill invading organisms, butmay also damage host tissues.Also derived from bone marrow, eosinophils multiply in both allergicdisorders and parasitic infestations. Although their phagocytic function isn tclearly understood, evidence suggests that they participate in host defenseagainst parasites. Their products may also diminish the inflammatoryresponse in allergic disorders.Two other types of cells that function in allergic disorders are basophilsand mast cells. (Mast cells, however, aren t blood cells.) Basophils circulatein peripheral blood, whereas mast cells accumulate in connective tissue,particularly in the lungs, intestines, and skin. Both types of cells have surfacereceptors for Ig E. When cross-linked by an Ig E antigen complex, theyrelease mediators characteristic of the allergic response.IMMUNE DISORDERSBecause of their complexity, the processes involved in host defense andimmune response may malfunction. When the body s defenses areexaggerated, misdirected, or either absent or depressed, the result may be ahypersensitivity disorder, autoimmunity, or immunodeficiency, respectively.Some forms of immunodeficiency are iatrogenic. (See Jatrogenicimmunodeficiency.)Iatrogenic immunodeficiency Iatrogenic immunodeficiency may be a complicating adverse effect ofchemotherapy or other treatments. At times, though, it s the goal oftherapy for example, to suppress immune-mediated tissue damage inautoimmune disorders or to prevent rejection of an organ transplant.As explained below, iatrogenic immunodeficiency may be induced byimmunosuppressive drugs, radiation therapy, or splenectomy.Immunosuppressive Drug Therapy Immunosuppressive drugs fall into several categories: Cytotoxic drugs. These drugs kill immunocompetent cells whilethey re replicating. However, most cytotoxic drugs aren t selective",13,93
850,"and thus interfere with all rapidly proliferating cells. As a result, theyreduce the number of lymphocytes as well as phagocytes. Besidesdepleting their number, cytotoxic drugs interfere with lymphocytesynthesis and release of immunoglobulins (Igs) and lymphokines.Cyclophosphamide, a potent and commonly used immunosuppressant,initially depletes the number of B cells, suppressing humoral immunity.However, chronic therapy also depletes T cells, suppressing cell-mediated immunity as well. Cyclophosphamide may be used in systemiclupus erythematosus, Wegener granulomatosis, other systemicvasculitides, and in certain autoimmune disorders. Because itnonselectively destroys rapidly dividing cells, this drug can cause severebone marrow suppression with neutropenia, anemia, andthrombocytopenia; gonadal suppression with sterility; alopecia;hemorrhagic cystitis; and nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis. It may alsoincrease the risk of lymphoproliferative neoplasms.Among other cytotoxic drugs used for immunosuppression areazathioprine (commonly used in kidney transplantation) and methotrexate(occasionally used in rheumatoid arthritis RA and other autoimmunedisorders).If the patient is receiving cytotoxic drugs, monitor the white blood cell(WBC) count. If it falls too low, the drug dosage may need to be adjusted.Also monitor urine output and watch for signs of cystitis, especially if thepatient is taking cyclophosphamide. Ensure adequate fluid intake (2 qt about 2 L daily). Give mesna as ordered to help prevent hemorrhagiccystitis. Provide antiemetics to relieve nausea and vomiting as ordered.Give meticulous oral hygiene and report signs of stomatitis.Teach the patient about the early signs and symptoms of infection. If the WBC count falls too low, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may beused to boost the count. Make sure the male patient understands the riskof sterility; advise sperm banking if appropriate.Young women may take hormonal contraceptives to minimize ovariandysfunction and to prevent pregnancy during administration of thesepotentially teratogenic drugs. Corticosteroids. These adrenocortical hormones are used to treatimmune-mediated disorders because of their potent anti-inflammatoryand immunosuppressive effects. Corticosteroids stabilize the vascularmembrane, blocking tissue infiltration by neutrophils and monocytes,",15,121
851,"thus inhibiting inflammation. They also kidnap T cells in the bonemarrow, causing lymphopenia. Because these drugs aren t cytotoxic,lymphocyte concentration can retum to normal within 24 hours afterthey re withdrawn. Corticosteroids also appear to inhibit Ig synthesisand to interfere with the binding of Ig to antigen or to cells withcrystallizable fragment (Fc) receptors. These drugs have many othereffects as well.The most commonly used oral corticosteroid is prednisone. For long-term therapy, prednisone is best given early in the moming to minimizeexogenous suppression of cortisol production and with food or milk tominimize gastric irritation. After the acute phase, it s usually reduced toan altemate-day schedule and then gradually withdrawn to minimizepotentially harmful adverse effects. Other corticosteroids used forimmunosuppression include hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, anddexamethasone.Chronic corticosteroid therapy can cause numerous adverse effects,which are sometimes more harmful than the disease itself. Neurologicadverse effects include euphoria, insomnia, or psychosis; cardiovasculareffects include hypertension and edema; and GI effects include gastricirritation, ulcers, and increased appetite with weight gain. Other possibleeffects are cataracts, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, muscleweakness, osteoporosis, delayed wound healing, and increasedsusceptibility to infection.During corticosteroid therapy, monitor the patient s blood pressure,weight, intake and output, and blood glucose. Instruct the patient to eat awell-balanced, low-salt diet or to follow the specially prescribed diet toprevent excessive weight gain. Remember that even though the patient ismore susceptible to infection, the patient shows fewer or less dramaticsigns of inflammation.Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine selectively suppresses the proliferationand development of helper T cells, resulting in depressed cell-mediatedimmunity. This drug is used primarily to prevent rejection of kidney,liver, and heart transplants but is also being investigated for use inseveral other disorders. Significant toxic effects of cyclosporineprimarily involve the liver and kidney, so treatment with this drugrequires regular evaluation of renal and hepatic function. Adjusting thedose or the duration of therapy helps minimize certain adverse effects.",16,112
852,"Antilymphocyte serum or antithymocyte globulin (ATG). This anti T-cell antibody reduces T-cell number and function, thus suppressingcell-mediated immunity. It has been used effectively to prevent cell-mediated rejection of tissue grafts or transplants. Usually, ATG isadministered immediately before the transplant and continued forsome time afterward. Potential adverse effects include anaphylaxisand serum sickness. Occurring to 2 weeks after injection of ATG,serum sickness is characterized by fever, malaise, rash, arthralgias,and, occasionally, glomerulonephritis or vasculitis. It presumablyresults from the deposition of immune complexes throughout the body.Radiation Therapy Because irradiation is cytotoxic to proliferating and intermitotic cells,including most lymphocytes, radiation therapy may induce profoundlymphopenia, resulting in immunosuppression. Irradiation of all majorlymph node areas a procedure known as total nodal irradiation isused to treat certain disorders such as Hodgkin lymphoma. Itseffectiveness in severe RA, lupus nephritis, and the prevention of kidneytransplant rejection is still under investigation.Splenectomy Splenectomy may be performed to manage various disorders, includingsplenic injury or trauma, tumor, Hodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia,Felty syndrome, Gaucher disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis, thalassemia major,and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.After splenectomy, the patient has increased susceptibility to infection.These patients should receive the pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent(Pneumovax) for prophylaxis and be wamed to avoid exposure toinfection and trauma.HYPERSENSITIVITY DISORDERSAn exaggerated or inappropriate immune response may lead to varioushypersensitivity disorders. Such disorders are classified as type I throughtype IV, although some overlap exists. (See Classification ofhypersensitivity reactions, pages 386 and 387.)",11,92

These, in tum, induce B-cell production of Ig E, which bindsto the Fc receptors on the surface of mast cells. When these cells are re-exposed to the same antigen, the antigen binds with the surface Ig E, cross-links the Fc receptors, and causes mast cell degranulation with release ofvarious mediators. (Degranulation may also be triggered by complement-derived anaphylatoxins C3a and CSa or by certain drugs such asmorphine.)",4,91
854,"Some of these mediators are preformed, whereas others are newlysynthesized upon activation of mast cells. Preformed mediators includeheparin, histamine, proteolytic and other enzymes, and chemotactic factorsfor eosinophils and neutrophils. Newly synthesized mediators includeprostaglandins and leukotrienes. Mast cells also produce a variety ofcytokines. The effects of these mediators include smooth-muscle contraction,vasodilation, bronchospasm, edema, increased vascular permeability, mucussecretion, and cellular infiltration by eosinophils and neutrophils. Amongclassic associated signs and symptoms are hypotension, wheezing, swelling,urticaria, and rhinorrhea.Examples of type I hypersensitivity disorders are anaphylaxis, atopy (anallergic reaction related to genetic predisposition), hay fever (allergicrhinitis), and, in some cases, asthma.Type Il Hypersensitivity (Antibody-Dependent Cytotoxicity)In type II hypersensitivity, antibody is directed against cell-surface antigens.(Altematively, though, antibody may be directed against small moleculesadsorbed to cells or against cell-surface receptors rather than against cellconstituents themselves.) Type II hypersensitivity then causes tissue damagethrough several mechanisms. Binding of antigen and antibody activatescomplement, which ultimately disrupts cellular membranes.Another mechanism is mediated by various phagocytic cells withreceptors for Ig (Fc region) and complement fragments. These cells envelopand destroy (phagocytize) opsonized targets, such as red blood cells (RBCs),white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. Antibody against these cells maybe visualized by immunofluorescence. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NKcells may contribute to tissue damage in type II hypersensitivity.Examples of type II hypersensitivity include transfusion reactions,hemolytic disease of the neonate, autoimmune hemolytic anemia,Goodpasture syndrome, and myasthenia gravis.Type Ill Hypersensitivity (Immune Complex Disease)In type III hypersensitivity, excessive circulating antigen-antibody complexes(immune complexes) result in the deposition of these complexes in tissue most commonly in the kidneys, joints, skin, and blood vessels. (Normally,immune complexes are effectively cleared by the reticuloendothelial system.)These deposited immune complexes activate the complement cascade,",14,111
855,"resulting in local inflammation. They also trigger platelet release ofvasoactive amines that increase vascular permeability, augmentingdeposition of immune complexes in vessel walls.Type III hypersensitivity may be associated with infections, such ashepatitis B and bacterial endocarditis; certain cancers in which a serumsickness-like syndrome may occur; and autoimmune disorders such as lupuserythematosus. This hypersensitivity reaction may also follow drug or serumtherapy.Type lv Hypersensitivity (Delayed Hypersensitivity)In type IV hypersensitivity, also known as cell-mediated hypersensitivity,antigen is processed by macrophages and presented to T cells. The sensitized T cells then release lymphokines, which recruit and activate otherlymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes.The coagulation, kinin, and complement pathways also contribute to tissuedamage in this type of reaction.Examples of type IV hypersensitivity include tuberculin reactions, contacthypersensitivity, and sarcoidosis.AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERSAutoimmunity is characterized by a misdirected immune response in whichthe body s defenses become self-destructive. Autoimmune diseases aren ttransmitted from one person to another, and the causes of autoimmunity aren tclearly understood. However, the process of autoimmunity is related to genesor a combination of genes, hormones, and environmental stimuli. Individualswith specific genes or gene combinations may be at a higher risk fordeveloping autoimmune disorders, which may be triggered by outsidestimuli, such as sun exposure, infection, drugs, or pregnancy.Recognition of self through the MHC is of primary importance in animmune response. However, how an immune response against self isprevented and which cells are primarily responsible isn t well understood.Many autoimmune disorders are characterized by B-cell hyperactivity,marked by proliferation of B cells and autoantibodies and byhypergammaglobulinemia. B-cell hyperactivity is probably related to T-cellabnormalities, but the molecular basis of autoimmunity is poorly understood.Hormonal and genetic factors strongly influence the incidence of autoimmunedisorders; for example, lupus erythematosus predominantly affects females of",9,98
856,"childbearing age, and certain HLA haplotypes are associated with anincreased risk of specific autoimmune disorders.Autoimmune diseases may not follow a clear pattem of symptoms;therefore, a definitive diagnosis may be delayed. Diagnosis may rely on thepatient s medical history; family history; physical examination, includingsigns and symptoms; and laboratory tests. Autoantibodies are usually foundwith such disorders as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupuserythematosus (SLE), but confusion may occur because individuals withthese disorders may have false-negative results on laboratory tests.Treatment for autoimmune disorders focuses on relieving symptoms,preserving organ function, and providing medication that can target theimmune system, such as cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine. Autoimmuneand immunologic disorders are being researched. Websites for the National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov) and other organizations offer substantialhealthcare information relevant to both the patient and the physician.IMMUNODEFICIENCYIn immunodeficiency, the immune response is absent or depressed, resultingin increased susceptibility to infection. This disorder may be primary orsecondary. Primary immunodeficiency reflects a defect involving T cells, Bcells, or lymphoid tissues. The National Primary Immunodeficiency Resource Center is a source of information on primary immunodeficiencysyndromes.Secondary immunodeficiency results from an underlying disease or factorthat depresses or blocks the immune response. The most common forms ofimmunodeficiency are caused by viral infection (as in acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome AIDS ).Allergy ASTHMAAsthma is a lung disease characterized by reversible obstruction omarrowing of the airways.Causes and Incidence",9,82
857,"Asthma that results from sensitivity to specific extemal allergens is known asextrinsic. In cases in which the allergen isn t obvious, asthma is referred toas intrinsic. Allergens that cause extrinsic asthma include pollen, animaldander, house dust or mold, kapok or feather pillows, food additivescontaining sulfites, and any other sensitizing substance. Extrinsic (atopic)asthma usually begins in childhood and is accompanied by othermanifestations of atopy (type I, Ig E-mediated allergy), such as eczema andallergic rhinitis. In intrinsic (nonatopic) asthma, no extrinsic allergen can beidentified. Most cases are preceded by a severe respiratory infection.Irritants, emotional stress, fatigue, exposure to noxious fumes as well aschanges in endocrine function, temperature, and humidity may aggravateintrinsic asthma attacks. In many asthmatics, intrinsic and extrinsic asthmacoexist.Several drugs and chemicals may provoke an asthma attack without usingthe Ig E pathway. Apparently, they trigger release of mast cell mediators byway of prostaglandin inhibition. Examples of these substances includeaspirin, various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs such asindomethacin and mefenamic acid), and tartrazine, a yellow food dye.Exercise may also provoke an asthma attack. In exercise-induced asthma,bronchospasm may follow heat and moisture loss in the upper airways.The allergic response has two phases. When the patient inhales anallergenic substance, sensitized Ig E antibodies trigger mast celldegranulation in the lung interstitium, releasing histamine, cytokines,prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and eosinophil chemotacticfactors. Histamine then attaches to receptor sites in the larger bronchi,causing irritation, inflammation, and edema. In the late phase, inflammatorycells flow in. The influx of eosinophils provides additional inflammatorymediators and contributes to local injury.Although this common condition can strike at any age, half of all cases firstoccur in children younger than age 10; in this age group, asthma affects twiceas many males as females. In the United States, 14 million adults and6 million children have asthma. Emergency department visits,hospitalizations, and mortality from asthma have been increasing for morethan 20 years, especially among children and blacks.Pathophysiology",16,123
858,"Asthma is characterized by reversible obstruction or narrowing of theairways, which are typically inflamed and hyperresponsive to a variety ofstimuli. It may resolve spontaneously or with treatment. Its symptoms rangefrom mild wheezing and dyspnea to life-threatening respiratory failure. (See Determining asthma s severity, page 389.) Symptoms of bronchial airwayobstruction may persist between acute episodes.Determining asthma s severity Asthma is classified by severity using these features: frequency, severity, and duration of symptoms degree of airflow obstruction (spirometry measure) or peakexpiratory flow (PEF)e frequency of nighttime symptoms and the degree to which the asthmainterferes with daily activities Severity can change over time, and even milder cases can becomesevere in an uncontrolled attack. Long-term therapy depends on whetherthe patient s asthma is classified as mild intermittent, mild persistent,moderate persistent, or severe persistent. For all patients, quick reliefcan be obtained by using a short-acting bronchodilator (2 to 4 puffs ofshort-acting inhaled beta,-adrenergic agonists as needed for symptoms).However, the use of a short-acting bronchodilator more than twice aweek in patients with intermittent asthma or daily or increasing use inpatients with persistent asthma may indicate the need to initiate orincrease long-term control therapy.Mild Intermittent Asthma The signs and symptoms of mild intermittent asthma include: daytime symptoms no more than twice a week nighttime symptoms no more than twice a month lung function testing (either PEF or forced expiratory volume in 1second) is 80 of predicted value or higher PEF varies no more than 20 Severe exacerbations, separated by long, symptomless periods ofnormal lung function, indicate mild intermittent asthma. A course of",8,86
859,"systemic corticosteroids is recommended for these exacerbations;otherwise, daily medication isn t required.Mild Persistent Asthma The signs and symptoms of mild persistent asthma include: daytime symptoms 3 to 6 days a week nighttime symptoms three to four times a month lung function testing 80 of predicted value or higher PEF between 20 and 30 The preferred treatment for mild, persistent asthma is low-doseinhaled corticosteroids, but altemative treatments include cromolyn, aleukotriene modifier, nedocromil, or sustained-release theophylline.Moderate Persistent Asthma The signs and symptoms of moderate persistent asthma include: daily daytime symptoms atleast weekly nighttime symptoms lung function testing 60 to 80 of predicted value PEF varying more than 30 The preferred treatment for moderate persistent asthma is low- ormedium-dose inhaled corticosteroids combined with a long-actinginhaled beta,-adrenergic agonist. Altemative treatments includeincreasing inhaled corticosteroids within the medium-dose range or low-or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids with either a leukotrienemodifier or theophylline.For recurring exacerbations, the preferred treatment is to increaseinhaled corticosteroids within the medium-dose range and add a long-acting inhaled beta,-adrenergic agonist. The altemative treatment is toincrease inhaled corticosteroids within the medium-dose range and addeither a leukotriene modifier or theophylline.Severe Persistent Asthma The signs and symptoms of severe persistent asthma include: continual daytime symptoms frequent nighttime symptoms lung function testing 60 of predicted value or lower PEF varying more than 30",3,79
860,"The preferred treatment for severe, persistent asthma includes high-dose inhaled corticosteroids combined with long-acting inhaled beta,-adrenergic agonists. Long-term administration of corticosteroid tablets orsyrup (2 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 60 mg/day) may be used to reduce theneed for systemic corticosteroid therapy.Complications Status asthmaticus Respiratory failure Signs and Symptoms An asthma attack may begin dramatically, with simultaneous onset of manysevere symptoms, or insidiously, with gradually increasing respiratorydistress. It typically includes progressively worsening shortness of breath,cough, wheezing, and chest tightness or some combination of these signs orsymptoms.During an acute attack, the cough sounds tight and dry. As the attacksubsides, tenacious mucoid sputum is produced (except in young children,who don t expectorate). Characteristic wheezing may be accompanied bycoarse rhonchi, but fine crackles aren t heard unless associated with arelated complication. Between acute attacks, breath sounds may be normal.The intensity of breath sounds in symptomatic asthma is typically reduced.A prolonged phase of forced expiration is typical of airflow obstruction.Evidence of lung hyperinflation (use of accessory muscles, for example) isparticularly common in children. Acute attacks may be accompanied bytachycardia, tachypnea, and diaphoresis. In severe attacks, the patient may beunable to speak more than a few words without pausing for breath. Cyanosis,confusion, and lethargy indicate the onset of respiratory failure.Diagnosis Laboratory studies in patients with asthma commonly show _ theseabnormalities: Pulmonary function studies reveal signs of airway obstruction (decreasedpeak expiratory flow rates and forced expiratory volume in second),low-normal or decreased vital capacity, and increased total lung and",9,94
861,"residual capacity. However, pulmonary function studies may be normalbetween attacks. Pulse oximetry may reveal decreased arterial oxygen saturation (Sao,). Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis provides the best indications of anattack s severity. In acutely severe asthma, the partial pressure of arterialoxygen is less than 60 mm Hg, the partial pressure of arterial carbondioxide (Paco,) is 40 mm Hg or more, and p H is usually decreased. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential reveals increasedeosinophil count. Chest X-rays may show hyperinflation with areas of focal atelectasis.Before initiating tests for asthma, rule out other causes of airwayobstruction and wheezing. In children, such causes include cystic fibrosis,tumors of the bronchi or mediastinum, and acute viral bronchitis; in adults,other causes include obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, andepiglottitis.Treatment Treatment of acute asthma aims to decrease bronchoconstriction, reducebronchial airway edema, and increase pulmonary ventilation. After an acuteepisode, treatment focuses on avoiding or removing precipitating factors,such as environmental allergens or irritants.If asthma is known to be caused by a particular antigen, it may be treatedby desensitizing the patient through a series of injections of limited amountsof the antigen. The aim is to curb the patient s immune response to theantigen.If asthma results from an infection, antibiotics are prescribed. Drugtherapy is most effective when begun soon after the onset of signs andsymptoms. For relief of symptoms in adults and children older than age 5,short-acting inhaled beta,-adrenergic agonists for bronchodilation may beused, and a course of systemic corticosteroids may be needed. Other controldrugs that may be used are leukotriene inhibitors, theophylline, zileuton,omalizumab, or cromolyn sodium. The goal of therapy is asthma control withminimal or no adverse effects from medication.Acute attacks that don t respond to self-treatment may require hospitalcare, beta,-adrenergic agonists by inhalation or subcutaneous injection (inthree doses over 60 to 90 minutes), and, possibly, oxygen for hypoxemia. If",15,105
862,"the patient responds poorly, systemic corticosteroids and, possibly,subcutaneous epinephrine may help. Beta,-adrenergic agonist inhalationcontinues hourly. I.V. theophylline, although rarely used, may be added to theregimen and I.V. fluid therapy is started. Patients who don t respond to thistreatment, whose airways remain obstructed, and who have increasingrespiratory difficulty are at risk for status asthmaticus and may requiremechanical ventilation.Treatment of status asthmaticus consists of aggressive drug therapy with abeta,-adrenergic agonist by nebulizer every 30 to 60 minutes, possiblysupplemented with subcutaneous epinephrine, IV corticosteroids, LV.theophylline, oxygen administration, IV. fluid therapy, and intubation andmechanical ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure (Paco, of 40 mm Hg or more). (See How status asthmaticus progresses, pages 390 and 391.)PATHOPHYSIOLOGYHOW STATUS ASTHMATICUS PROGRESSESA potentially fatal complication, status asthmaticus arises whenimpaired gas exchange and heightened airway resistance increase thework of breathing. This flow chart shows the stages of status asthmaticus. Special Considerations During an acute attack, proceed as follows:First, assess the severity of asthma. Administer the prescribed treatments and assess the patient s response. Place the patient in high Fowler s position. Encourage pursed-lip anddiaphragmatic breathing. Help the patient to relax. Administer prescribed humidified oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 L/minuteto ease breathing and to increase Sao,. Later, adjust oxygen according to",17,72
863,"the patient s vital signs and ABG levels. Anticipate intubation and mechanical ventilation if the patient fails tomaintain adequate oxygenation. Monitor serum theophylline levels to ensure they re in the therapeuticrange. Observe your patient for signs and symptoms of theophyllinetoxicity (vomiting, diarrhea, and headache), as well as for signs ofsubtherapeutic dosage (respiratory distress and increased wheezing). Observe the frequency and severity of your patient s cough, and notewhether it s productive. Then auscultate the lungs, noting adventitious orabsent breath sounds. If the cough isn t productive and rhonchi arepresent, teach the patient effective coughing techniques. If the patient cantolerate postural drainage and chest percussion, perform these proceduresto clear secretions. Suction an intubated patient as needed. Treat dehydration with I.V. fluids until the patient can tolerate oral fluids,which will help loosen secretions. If conservative treatment fails to improve the airway obstruction,anticipate bronchoscopy or bronchial lavage when a lobe or larger areacollapses.ALERT Monitor the patients vital signs. Keep in mind that developingor increasing tachypnea may indicate worsening asthma or drugtoxicity. Blood pressure readings may reveal pulsus paradoxus, indicatingsevere asthma. Hypertension may indicate asthma-related hypoxemia.During long-term care, proceed as follows:Monitor the patient s respiratory status to detect baseline changes, toassess response to treatment, and to prevent or detect complications. Auscultate the lungs frequently, noting the degree of wheezing and qualityof air movement.Review ABG levels, pulmonary function test results, and Sao, readings.If the patient is taking systemic corticosteroids, observe forcomplications, such as elevated blood glucose levels and friable skin andbruising. Cushingoid effects resulting from long-term use of corticosteroids may beminimized by altemate-day dosage or use of prescribed inhaledcorticosteroids.",17,108
864,"If the patient is taking corticosteroids by inhaler, watch for signs ofcandidal infection in the mouth and pharynx. Using an extender device andrinsing the mouth afterward may prevent this. Observe the patient s anxiety level. Keep in mind that measures thatreduce hypoxemia and breathlessness should help relieve anxiety.Keep the room temperature comfortable and use an air conditioner or afan in hot, humid weather. Control exercise-induced asthma by instructing the patient to use abronchodilator or cromolyn 30 minutes before exercise. Also instruct thepatient to use pursed-lip breathing while exercising.All patients should know the following: Teach the patient and family to avoid known allergens and irritants. Describe to the patient prescribed drugs, including their names, dosages,actions, adverse effects, and special instructions. Teach the patient how to use a metered-dose inhaler. If the patient hasdifficulty using an inhaler, the patient may need an extender device tooptimize drug delivery and lower the risk of candidal infection withorally inhaled corticosteroids. Ifthe patient has moderate to severe asthma, explain how to use a peakflow meter to measure the degree of airway obstruction. Tell the patient tokeep a record of peak flow readings and to bring it to medicalappointments. Explain the importance of calling the physician at once ifthe peak flow drops suddenly (may signal severe respiratory problems). Tell the patient to notify the physician if developing a fever above 100 F(37.8 C), chest pain, shortness of breath without coughing or exercising,or uncontrollable coughing. An uncontrollable asthma attack requiresimmediate attention. Teach the patient diaphragmatic and pursed-lip breathing as well aseffective coughing techniques. Urge the patient to drink at least 3 qt (3 L) of fluids daily to help loosensecretions and maintain hydration.ALLERGIC RHINITISAllergic rhinitis is a reaction to airbome (inhaled) allergens. Depending onthe allergen, the resulting rhinitis and conjunctivitis may occur seasonally(hay fever) or year-round (perennial allergic rhinitis).",17,106
865,"Causes and Incidence In most cases, it s induced by windbome pollens: in the spring by treepollens (oak, elm, maple, alder, birch, and cottonwood), in the summer bygrass pollens (sheep sorrel and English plantain), and in the fall by weedpollens (ragweed). Occasionally, hay fever is induced by allergy to fungalspores. In addition to individual sensitivity and geographic differences inplant population, the amount of pollen in the air can be a factor indetermining whether symptoms develop. Hot, dry, windy days have morepollen than cool, damp, rainy days.The major perennial allergens and irritants include dust mites, featherpillows, mold, cigarette smoke, upholstery, and animal dander. Seasonalpollen allergy may exacerbate signs and symptoms of perennial rhinitis.Allergic rhinitis is the most common atopic allergic reaction, affectingmore than 20 million Americans. It s most prevalent in young children andadolescents but can occur in all age groups.Pathophysiology Hay fever reflects an Ig E-mediated type I hypersensitivity response to anenvironmental antigen (allergen) in a genetically susceptible individual.In perennial allergic rhinitis, inhaled allergens provoke antigen responsesthat produce recurring symptoms year-round. The allergens trigger antibodyproduction and histamine release, producing itching, swelling, and mucus.Complications Secondary sinus and middle ear infections Nasal polyps Nasal obstruction Signs and Symptoms In seasonal allergic rhinitis, the key signs and symptoms are paroxysmalsneezing, profuse watery rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction or congestion, andpruritus of the nose and eyes. It s usually accompanied by pale, cyanotic,edematous nasal mucosa; red and edematous eyelids and conjunctivae;excessive lacrimation; and headache or sinus pain. Some patients alsocomplain of itching in the throat and malaise.",9,111
866,"In perennial allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and other extranasal effects arerare, but chronic nasal obstruction is common. In many cases, this obstructionextends to eustachian tube obstruction, particularly in children.In both types of allergic rhinitis, dark circles may appear under thepatient s eyes ( allergic shiners ) because of venous congestion in themaxillary sinuses. The severity of signs and symptoms may vary from seasonto season and from year to year.Diagnosis Microscopic examination of sputum and nasal secretions reveals largenumbers of eosinophils. Blood chemistry shows normal or elevated Ig E. Adefinitive diagnosis is based on the patient s personal and family history ofallergies as well as physical findings during a symptomatic phase. Skintesting paired with tested responses to environmental stimuli can pinpoint theresponsible allergens given the patient s history. In patients who can ttolerate skin testing, the radioallergosorbent test may be helpful indetermining specific allergen sensitivity.To distinguish between allergic rhinitis and other nasal mucosa disorders,remember these differences: Inchronic vasomotor rhinitis, eye symptoms are absent, rhinorrhea ismucoid, and seasonal variation is absent. In infectious rhinitis (the common cold), the nasal mucosa is beet red;nasal secretions contain polymorphonuclear, not eosinophilic, exudate;and signs and symptoms include fever and sore throat. This condition isn ta recurrent seasonal phenomenon. In rhinitis medicamentosa, which results from excessive use of nasalsprays or drops, nasal drainage and mucosal redness and swellingdisappear when such medication is withheld.i PEDIATRIC TIP In children, differential diagnosis involves ruling out anasal foreign body, such as a bean or a button.Treatment Treatment aims to control symptoms by eliminating the environmentalantigen, if possible, and providing drug therapy and immunotherapy.",9,92
867,"Antihistamines block histamine effects but commonly produceanticholinergic adverse effects (sedation, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness,blurred vision, and nervousness). Antihistamines, such as cetirizine,loratadine, and fexofenadine, produce fewer adverse effects and are lesslikely to cause sedation.Inhaled intranasal steroids produce local anti-inflammatory effects withminimal systemic adverse effects. The most commonly used intranasalsteroids are beclomethasone, flunisolide, fluticasone, mometasone, andtriamcinolone. These drugs are effective when symptoms aren t relieved byantihistamines alone.Advise the patient to use intranasal steroids regularly as prescribed foroptimal effectiveness. Oral or parenteral steroids may be used for 6 to 8weeks when conventional therapy isn t working. Cromolyn may be helpful intreating hay fever, but this drug may take up to 4 weeks to produce asatisfactory effect and must be taken regularly during allergy season. Eyedrop versions of cromolyn and antihistamines are available for itchy,bloodshot eyes.Long-term management includes immunotherapy, or desensitization withinjections of extracted allergens, administered before or during allergyseason or perennially. Seasonal allergies require particularly close dosageregulation.Special Considerations Before desensitization injections, assess the patient s symptom status.Afterward, watch for adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis and severelocalized erythema.ALERT Keep epinephrine and emergency resuscitation equipmentavailable, and observe the patient for 30 minutes after the injection.Instruct the patient to call the physician if a delayed reaction shouldoccur.The following protocol is recommended for allergic rhinitis: Monitor the patient s compliance with prescribed drug treatmentregimens. Also, carefully note any changes in the control of symptoms orany signs of drug misuse.",9,97
868,"To reduce environmental exposure to airbome allergens, suggest that thepatient sleep with the windows closed, avoid the countryside duringpollination seasons, use air-conditioning to filter allergens and minimizemoisture and dust, and eliminate dust-collecting items, such as woolblankets, deep-pile carpets, and heavy drapes, from the home. Insevere and resistant cases, suggest that the patient consider drasticchanges in lifestyle such as relocation to a pollen-free area eitherseasonally or year-round. Be aware that some patients may develop chronic complications,including sinusitis and nasal polyps.ATOPIC DERMATITISAtopic dermatitis is a chronic type I immediate hypersensitivity skin disorderthat s characterized by superficial skin inflammation and intense itching.Although this disorder may appear at any age, it typically begins duringinfancy or early childhood. It may then subside spontaneously, followed byexacerbations in late childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Atopicdermatitis affects 2.5 of the population.Causes and Incidence The cause of atopic dermatitis is still unknown.Exacerbating factors of atopic dermatitis include irritants, infections(commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus), and some allergens. Althoughno reliable link exists between atopic dermatitis and exposure to inhalantallergens (such as house dust and animal dander), exposure to food allergens(such as soybeans, fish, or nuts) may coincide with flare-ups of atopicdermatitis.Pathophysiology Several theories attempt to explain its pathogenesis. One theory suggests anunderlying metabolically or biochemically induced skin disorder that sgenetically linked to elevated serum Ig E levels. Another theory suggestsdefective T-cell function.Complications Scarring",8,84
869,"Secondary infection Signs and Symptoms Scratching the skin causes vasoconstriction and intensifies pruritus, resultingin erythematous, weeping lesions. Eventually, the lesions become scaly andlichenified. Usually, they re located in areas of flexion and extension, such asthe neck, antecubital fossa, popliteal folds, and behind the ears. Patients withatopic dermatitis are prone to unusually severe viral infections, bacterial andfungal skin infections, ocular complications, and allergic contact dermatitis.Diagnosis Typically, the patient has a history of atopy, such as asthma, hay fever, orurticaria; the family may have a similar history. Laboratory tests revealeosinophilia and elevated serum Ig E levels. A skin biopsy may beperformed, but it isn t always required to make the diagnosis.Treatment Measures to ease this chronic disorder include meticulous skin care,environmental control of offending allergens, and drug therapy. Because dryskin aggravates itching, frequent application of nonirritating topicallubricants is important, especially after bathing or showering. Minimizingexposure to allergens and irritants, such as wools and harsh detergents, alsohelps control symptoms.Drug therapy involves corticosteroids and antipruritics. Atopic dermatitisresponds well to topical corticosteroids, which should be appliedimmediately after bathing for optimal penetration. Oral antihistamines arecommonly used to help control itching. A bedtime dose may reduceinvoluntary scratching during sleep. If secondary infection develops,antibiotics are necessary. Topical immunomodulatory agents are a steroid-free treatment for itching and rash and have demonstrated an 80 successrate in studies.Special Considerations Monitor the patient s compliance with drug therapy. Teach the patient when and how to apply topical corticosteroids.",14,87
870,"Emphasize the importance of regular personal hygiene using only waterwith little soap. Be alert for signs and symptoms of secondary infection; teach the patienthow to recognize them as well. If the patient s diet is modified to exclude food allergens, monitomutritional status. Offer support to help the patient and family cope with this chronicdisorder. Discourage use of laundry additives. Dissuade the patient from scratching during urticaria to help prevent aninfection.LATEX ALLERGYLatex is a substance found in an increasing number of products both on thejob and in the home environment. Latex allergy is a hypersensitivity reactionto products that contain natural latex, which is derived from the sap of arubber tree, not synthetic latex.Causes and Incidence About 1 of the population has a latex allergy. Anyone who is in frequentcontact with latex-containing products is at risk for developing a latexallergy. (See Products that contain latex, page 395.) The more frequent theexposure, the higher the risk. The populations at highest risk are medical anddental professionals, workers in latex companies, and patients with spinabifida.Products that contain latex Many medical and everyday items contain latex, which can be a threat tothe patient with latex allergy. The most common items that contain latexare listed below.Medical Products Adhesive bandages Airways, nasogastric tubes Blood pressure cuff, tubing, and bladder",12,76

872,"There are two types of latex allergy. A type I hypersensitivity reactioninvolves mast cells releasing histamine and other secretory products. Thisleads to vasodilation and bronchoconstriction. A type IV delayedhypersensitivity reaction occurs as a reaction to chemicals involved inprocessing rather than to the latex itself. Sensitized T lymphocytes aretriggered, which cause other lymphocytes and mononuclear cells toproliferate, resulting in tissue inflammation.Other individuals at risk include: patients with a history of asthma or other allergies, especially to bananas,avocados, tropical fruits, or chestnuts patients with a history of multiple intra-abdominal or GU surgeries patients who require frequent intermittent urinary catheterization Complications Respiratory obstruction Systemic vascular collapse Signs and Symptoms Type I symptoms can include rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, andanaphylaxis. Type IV symptoms may include contact dermatitis withvesicular skin lesions, pruritus, edema, and erythema. Although type IVhypersensitivity is not life-threatening, those who are sensitized to latex areat increased risk for development of type I reactions.Diagnosis A patient who describes even the mildest symptoms during a history andphysical assessment should be suspected of having a latex allergy. Thepatient may describe dermatitis or mild respiratory distress when using latexgloves, inflating a balloon, or coming in contact with other latex products.fey CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS A blood test for latex sensitivity can confirmthe diagnosis. This test, which measures specific Ig E antibodiesagainst latex, should be used only when latex allergy is suspected; it isn trecommended as a screening tool.Treatment",9,93
873,"The best treatment of latex allergy is prevention; the more a latex-sensitiveperson is exposed to latex, the worse the symptoms will become. To avoidexposure, advise the patient to substitute products made of silicone and vinylfor those made of latex.When a latex allergy is suspected or known, the patient may receivemedications before and after surgery or other invasive procedures. Pre- andpost-procedure medications may include corticosteroids, antihistamines, and H,-receptor antagonists.There s no known treatment for an allergic reaction to latex. Care issupportive in nature. The patient s airway, breathing, and circulation must bemonitored. An artificial airway, oxygen therapy, cardiopulmonaryresuscitation, and fluid management may be necessary. During an acutereaction, epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and hydrocortisone are commonlyadministered by I.V. infusion.Special Considerations Urge the patient to wear an identification tag mentioning latex allergy. Teach the patient and family members how to use an epinephrineautoinjector. Teach the patient to be aware of all latex-containing products and to usevinyl or silicone products instead. Advise the patient that Mylar balloonsdon t contain latex.BESEEa S PREVENTION Make sure that items that arent available in a latex-free form, such asstethoscopes and blood pressure cuffs, are wrapped in cloth before theycome in contact with a hypersensitive patient s skin. Place the patient in a private room or with another patient who requiresa latex-free environment. When adding medication to an LV. bag, inject the drug through thespike port, not the rubber latex port.ANAPHYLAXISAnaphylaxis is a dramatic, acute atopic reaction marked by the sudden onsetof rapidly progressive urticaria and respiratory distress. A severe reaction",15,87
874,"may precipitate vascular collapse, leading to systemic shock, and,sometimes, death.Causes and Incidence The source of anaphylactic reactions is ingestion of, or other systemicexposure to, sensitizing drugs or other substances. Such substances mayinclude animal serums, vaccines, allergen extracts, enzymes (L-asparaginase), hormones, penicillin and other antibiotics, sulfonamides,local anesthetics, salicylates, polysaccharides, diagnostic chemicals(sulfobromophthalein, sodium dehydrocholate, and radiographic contrastmedia), foods (especially legumes, nuts, berries, seafood, and egg albumin)and sulfite-containing food additives, insect venom (honeybees, wasps,homets, yellow jackets, fire ants, mosquitoes, and certain spiders), and,rarely, ruptured hydatid cyst.A common cause of anaphylaxis is penicillin, which induces anaphylaxisin to 4 of every 10,000 patients treated with it. Penicillin is most likely toinduce anaphylaxis after parenteral administration or prolonged therapy andin atopic patients with an allergy to other drugs or foods. (See Preventingallergic response to penicillin.)PREVENTIONPREVENTING ALLERGIC RESPONSE TOPENICILLINWhen administering penicillin or its derivatives, such as ampicillin orcarbenicillin, follow these recommendations from the World Health Organization to prevent an allergic response: Have an emergency kit available to treat allergic reactions. Take a detailed patient history, including penicillin allergy and otherallergies. In an infant younger than 3 months, check for penicillinallergy in the mother. Never give penicillin to a patient who has had an allergic reaction toit. Before giving penicillin to a patient with suspected penicillin allergy,refer the patient for skin and immunologic tests to confirm it.",9,96
875,"Always tell a patient he s going to receive penicillin before taking thefirst dose. Observe the patient carefully for adverse effects for at least half anhour after penicillin administration. Be aware that penicillin derivatives also may elicit an allergicreaction.At the same time, two other chemical mediators, bradykinin andleukotrienes, induce vascular collapse by stimulating contraction of certaingroups of smooth muscles and by increasing vascular permeability. In tum,increased vascular permeability leads to decreased peripheral resistance andplasma leakage from the circulation to extravascular tissues, which lowersblood volume, causing hypotension, hypovolemic shock, and cardiacdysfunction. (See Understanding anaphylaxis, page 397.)PATHOPHYSIOLOGYUNDERSTANDING ANAPHYLAXISThe illustrations below teach the development of anaphylaxis.Response To Antigen Immunoglobulins (Ig) M and G recognize and bind the antigen. Release of Chemical Mediators",7,45
876,"Activated Ig E on basophils promotes the release of mediators: histamine,serotonin, and leukotrienes. Intensified Response Mast cells release more histamine and eosinophil chemotactic factor ofanaphylaxis. Respiratory Distress In the lungs, histamine causes endothelial cell destruction and allowsfluid to leak into alveoli.",3,19
877,"Deterioration Meanwhile, mediators increase vascular permeability, causing fluid toleak from the vessels. Failure of Compensatory Mechanisms Endothelial cell damage causes basophils and mast cells to releaseheparin and mediator-neutralizing substances. However, anaphylaxis isnow irreversible.",3,18
878,"Complement cascade Prostaglandins Histamine H ECF-A BDSerotonin Bradykinin Leukotrienes 3 Heparin A Pathophysiology An anaphylactic reaction requires previous sensitization or exposure to thespecific antigen, resulting in the production of specific Ig E antibodies byplasma cells. This antibody production takes place in the lymph nodes and isenhanced by helper T cells. Ig E antibodies then bind to membrane receptorson mast cells (found throughout connective tissue) and basophils.On re-exposure, the antigen binds to adjacent Ig E antibodies or cross-linked Ig E receptors, activating a series of cellular reactions that triggerdegranulation the release of powerful chemical mediators (such ashistamine and eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis) from mast cellstores. Ig G or Ig M enters into the reaction and activates the release ofcomplement fractions.Complications Respiratory obstruction Systemic vascular collapse Death",4,50
879,"Signs and Symptoms An anaphylactic reaction produces sudden physical distress within secondsor minutes (although a delayed or persistent reaction may occur for up to 24hours) after exposure to an allergen. The reaction s severity is inverselyrelated to the interval between exposure to the allergen and the onset ofsymptoms. Usually, the first symptoms include a feeling of impending doomor fright, weakness, sweating, sneezing, shortness of breath, nasal pruritus,urticaria, and angioedema, followed rapidly by symptoms in one or moretarget organs.Cardiovascular symptoms include hypotension, shock, and, sometimes,cardiac arrhythmias. If untreated, arrhythmia may precipitate circulatorycollapse. Respiratory symptoms can occur at any level in the respiratory tractand commonly include nasal mucosal edema, profuse watery rhinorrhea,itching, nasal congestion, and sudden sneezing attacks. Edema of the upperrespiratory tract results in hypopharyngeal and laryngeal obstruction(hoarseness, stridor, and dyspnea). This is an early sign of acute respiratoryfailure, which can be fatal. GI and GU symptoms include severe stomachcramps, nausea, diarrhea, and urinary urgency and incontinence.Diagnosis Anaphylaxis can be diagnosed by the rapid onset of severe respiratory orcardiovascular signs and symptoms after ingestion or injection of a drug,vaccine, diagnostic agent, food, or food additive or after an insect sting. Ifthese symptoms occur without a known allergic stimulus, rule out otherpossible causes of shock (acute myocardial infarction, status asthmaticus, orheart failure).Tests that help determine a patient s risk of anaphylaxis include skin teststhat may show hypersensitivity to a specific allergen and an elevated serum Ig E level.Treatment Anaphylaxis is always an emergency. It requires an immediate injection ofepinephrine 1:1,000 aqueous solution, 0.1 to 0.5 m L, repeated every 5 to 20minutes as needed.In the early stages of anaphylaxis, when the patient hasn t lostconsciousness and is normotensive, give epinephrine I.M. or subcutaneously",11,108
880,"and help it move into circulation faster by massaging the injection site. Insevere reactions, when the patient has lost consciousness and is hypotensive,give epinephrine I. V.ALERT Maintain airway patency. Observe the patient for early signsof laryngeal edema (hoarseness, stridor, and dyspnea), which willprobably require endotracheal tube insertion or a tracheotomy and oxygentherapy.In case of cardiac arrest, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation, includingclosed-chest heart massage, assisted ventilation, and other therapies asindicated by clinical response.Watch for hypotension and shock, and maintain circulatory volume withvolume expanders (plasma, plasma expanders, saline, and albumin) asneeded. Stabilize blood pressure with the IV. vasopressors norepinephrineand dopamine. Monitor blood pressure, central venous pressure, and urineoutput as a response index.After the initial emergency, administer other medications as ordered:subcutaneous epinephrine, longer-acting epinephrine, corticosteroids, and I.V. diphenhydramine for long-term management and an inhaled beta-agonistfor bronchospasm.Special Considerations . PREVENTION Teach the patient to avoid exposure to known allergens. A personallergic to certain foods or drugs must leam to avoid the offending foodor drug in all its forms. A person allergic to insect stings should avoidopen fields and wooded areas during the insect season. An anaphylaxiskit (epinephrine, antihistamine, and toumiquet) should also be carriedwhenever the patient with known severe allergic reactions goesoutdoors. In addition, every patient prone to anaphylaxis should wear amedical identification bracelet identifying allergies. If a patient must receive a drug to which he or she s allergic, prevent asevere reaction by making sure the patient receives carefuldesensitization with gradually increasing doses of the antigen or",13,97
881,"advance administration of steroids. Of course, a person with a knownallergic history should receive a drug with a high anaphylacticpotential only after cautious pretesting for sensitivity. Closely monitorthe patient during testing, and make sure you have resuscitativeequipment and epinephrine ready. When any patient needs a drug with ahigh anaphylactic potential (particularly parenteral drugs), make surethey received each dose under close medical observation. Closely monitor a patient undergoing diagnostic tests that useradiographic contrast media, such as excretory urography, cardiaccatheterization, and angiography.URTICARIA AND ANGIOEDEMAUrticaria, commonly known as hives, is an episodic, usually self-limited skinreaction characterized by local dermal wheals surrounded by anerythematous flare. Angioedema is a subcutaneous and dermal eruption thatproduces deeper, larger wheals (usually on the hands, feet, lips, genitals, andeyelids) and a more diffuse swelling of loose subcutaneous tissue. Urticariaand angioedema can occur simultaneously, but angioedema may last longer.Causes and Incidence Urticaria and angioedema are common allergic reactions that may occur in20 of the general population. The causes of these reactions include allergyto drugs, foods, insect bites and stings, and, occasionally, inhalant allergens(animal dander and cosmetics) that provoke an Ig E-mediated response toprotein allergens. However, certain drugs may cause urticaria without an Ig Eresponse. When urticaria and angioedema are part of an anaphylacticreaction, they almost always persist long after the systemic response hassubsided. This occurs because circulation to the skin is the last to be restoredafter an allergic reaction, which results in slow histamine reabsorption at thereaction site.Nonallergic urticaria and angioedema are also related to histaminerelease. Extemal physical stimuli, such as cold (usually in young adults),heat, water, or sunlight, may also provoke urticaria and angioedema.Dermographism urticaria, which develops after stroking or scratching of theskin, occurs in as much as 20 of the population. Such urticaria developswith varying pressure, usually under tight clothing, and is aggravated byscratching.",13,101
882,"Pathophysiology Several different mechanisms and underlying disorders may provokeurticaria and angioedema. These include Ig E-induced release of mediatorsfrom cutaneous mast cells; binding of Ig G or Ig M to antigen, resulting incomplement activation; and such disorders as localized or secondaryinfections (such as respiratory infection), neoplastic diseases (such as Hodgkin lymphoma), connective tissue diseases (such as SLE), collagenvascular diseases, and psychogenic diseases.Complications Infection from scratching Laryngeal edema (upper respiratory tract involvement)Severe abdominal colic (GI involvement)Signs and Symptoms The characteristic features of urticaria are distinct, raised, evanescent(temporary) dermal wheals surrounded by an erythematous flare. Theselesions may vary in size. In cholinergic urticaria, the wheals may be tiny andblanched, surrounded by erythematous flares.Angioedema characteristically produces nonpitted swelling of deepsubcutaneous tissue, usually on the eyelids, lips, genitalia, and mucousmembranes. These swellings don t usually itch but may bum and tingle.Diagnosis An accurate patient history can help determine the cause of urticaria. Such ahistory should include: drug history, including over-the-counter preparations (vitamins, aspirin,and antacids) frequently ingested foods (strawberries, milk products, fish) environmental influences (pets, carpet, clothing, soap, inhalants,cosmetics, hair dye, and insect bites and stings)Diagnosis also requires physical assessment to rule out similar conditionsas well as a CBC, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and achest X-ray to rule out inflammatory infections. Skin testing, an eliminationdiet, and a food diary (recording time and amount of food eaten and",7,91
883,"circumstances) can pinpoint provoking allergens. The food diary may alsosuggest other allergies. For instance, a patient allergic to fish may also beallergic to iodine contrast materials.Recurrent angioedema without urticaria, along with a familial history,points to hereditary angioedema. (See Hereditary angioedema, page 400.)Decreased serum levels of complement 4 and complement 1 esteraseinhibitors confirm this diagnosis.Hereditary angioedema A nonallergenic type of angioedema, hereditary angioedema results froman autosomal dominant trait a hereditary deficiency of an alphaglobulin, the normal inhibitor of Cl esterase (a component of thecomplement system). This deficiency allows uninhibited Cl esteraserelease, resulting in the vascular changes common to angioedema.The clinical effects of hereditary angioedema usually appear inchildhood with recurrent episodes of subcutaneous or submucosal edemaat irregular intervals of weeks, months, or years, in many cases aftertrauma or stress. Hereditary angioedema is unifocal, without urticarialpruritus, but associated with recurrent edema of the skin and mucosa(especially of the GI and respiratory tracts). GI tract involvement maycause nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. Laryngealangioedema may cause fatal airway obstruction.Treatment of acute hereditary angioedema may require androgens suchas danazol. Tracheotomy may be necessary to relieve airway obstructionresulting from laryngeal angioedema.Treatment Treatment aims to prevent or limit contact with triggering factors or, if this isimpossible, to desensitize the patient to them and to relieve symptoms.During desensitization, progressively larger doses of specific antigens(determined by skin testing) are injected intradermally. After the triggeringstimulus has been removed, urticaria usually subsides in a few days exceptfor drug reactions, which may persist as long as the drug is in thebloodstream.",11,93
884,"Diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or another antihistamine can ease itchingand swelling in every kind of urticaria. Corticosteroid therapy may benecessary for some patients.Special Considerations Inform the patient receiving antihistamines of the possibility ofdrowsiness.Suggest cool compresses to reduce swelling and pain. A cool bath may beused for large areas. Calamine lotion may be soothing as well. Avoid hot baths, which can cause hives to retum. Advise the patient to avoid tight-fitting clothing.BLOOD TRANSFUSION REACTIONMediated by immune or nonimmune factors, a transfusion reactionaccompanies or follows I.V. administration of blood components. Its severityvaries from mild (fever and chills) to severe (acute renal failure or completevascular collapse and death), depending on the amount of blood transfused,the type of reaction, and the patient s general health.Causes and Incidence Mismatched blood Rh-incompatible blood Allergic reactions Febrile nonhemolytic reactions Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALID) Bacterial contamination Pathophysiology Acute hemolytic reactions follow transfusion of mismatched blood.Transfusion of serologically incompatible blood triggers the most seriousreaction, marked by intravascular agglutination of RBCs. The recipient santibodies (Ig G or Ig M) attach to the donated RBCs, leading to widespreadclumping and destruction of the recipient s RBCs and, possibly, thedevelopment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and otherserious effects.",9,78
885,"Transfusion of Rh-incompatible blood triggers a less serious reactionwithin several days to 2 weeks. Rh reactions are most common in femalessensitized to RBC antigens by prior pregnancy or by unknown factors (suchas bacterial or viral infection) and in people who have received more thanfive transfusions. (See Understanding the Rh system.)Understanding the Rh System The Rh system contains more than 30 antibodies and antigens. Eighty-fivepercent of the world s population is Rh-positive, which means that thered blood cells of most people carry the D or Rh antigen. The remaining15 of the population, who are Rh-negative, don t carry this antigen.When Rh-negative people receive Rh-positive blood for the first time,they become sensitized to the D antigen but show no immediate reactionto it. If they receive Rh-positive blood a second time, they then develop amassive hemolytic reaction. For example, an Rh-negative mother whodelivers an Rh-positive baby is sensitized by the baby s Rh-positiveblood. During the next Rh-positive pregnancy, sensitized blood wouldcause a hemolytic reaction in fetal circulation. Thus, the Rh-negativemother should receive Rh,(D) immune globulin (human) IM. within 72hours after delivering an Rh-positive baby to prevent the formation ofantibodies against Rh-positive blood.Allergic reactions are fairly common but only occasionally serious. In thistype of reaction, transfused soluble antigens react with surface Ig E moleculeson mast cells and basophils, causing degranulation and release of allergicmediators. Antibodies against Ig A in an Ig A-deficient recipient can alsotrigger a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).Febrile nonhemolytic reactions, the most common type of reaction,apparently develop when cytotoxic or agglutinating antibodies in therecipient s plasma attack antigens on transfused lymphocytes, granulocytes,or plasma cells.TRALI occurs when acutely increased permeability of the pulmonarymicrocirculation causes massive leakage of fluids and protein into thealveolar spaces and interstitium, usually within 6 hours of transfusion. In",14,102
886,"many cases, it is associated with the presence of granulocyte antibodies inthe donor or recipient, causing complement and histamine release.Although uncommon, bacterial contamination of donor blood can occurduring donor phlebotomy. Offending organisms are usually gram-negative,especially Pseudomonas species, Citrobacter freundii, and Escherichiacoli.Contamination of donor blood with viruses, such as _ hepatitis,cytomegalovirus, and malaria, is also possible.Complications Bronchospasm Respiratory failure Acute tubular necrosis Acute renal failure Anaphylactic shock Vascular collapse DICSigns and Symptoms Immediate effects of a hemolytic transfusion reaction develop within a fewminutes or hours after the start of the transfusion and may include chills,fever, urticaria, tachycardia, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, tightness in the chest,chest and back pain, hypotension, bronchospasm, angioedema, and signs andsymptoms of anaphylaxis, shock, pulmonary edema, heart failure, and renalfailure. In a surgical patient under anesthesia, these symptoms are masked,but blood oozes from mucous membranes or the incision site.Delayed hemolytic reactions can occur up to several weeks after atransfusion, causing fever, an unexpected fall in serum hemoglobin (Hb)level, and jaundice.Allergic reactions are typically afebrile and characterized by urticaria andangioedema, possibly progressing to cough, respiratory distress, nausea,vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, vascular instability, shock, and coma.The hallmark of febrile nonhemolytic reactions is mild to severe fever thatmay begin at the start of transfusion or within 2 hours after its completion.Symptoms of TRALI include severe respiratory distress within 6 hours oftransfusion, fever, chills, cyanosis, and hypotension.",3,105
887,"Bacterial contamination produces a high fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,abdominal cramps, and, possibly, shock. Symptoms of viral contaminationmay not appear for several weeks after transfusion.Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Confirming a hemolytic transfusion reactionrequires proof of blood incompatibility and evidence of hemolysis,such as hemoglobinuria, anti-A or anti-B antibodies in the serum, lowserum Hb levels, and elevated bilirubin levels.If you suspect such a reaction, have the patient s blood retyped andcrossmatched with the donor s blood. After a hemolytic transfusion reaction,laboratory tests will show increased indirect bilirubin levels, decreasedhaptoglobin levels, increased serum Hb levels, and Hb in the urine. As thereaction progresses, tests may show signs of DIC (thrombocytopenia,increased prothrombin time, and decreased fibrinogen level) and acutetubular necrosis (increased blood urea nitrogen BUN and serum creatininelevels).A blood culture to isolate the causative organism should be done whenbacterial contamination is suspected.Treatment At the first sign of a hemolytic reaction, stop the transfusion immediately.Depending on the nature of the patient s reaction, prepare to: monitor vital signs every 15 to 30 minutes, watching for signs of shock. maintain a patent I.V. line with normal saline solution; insert an indwellingcatheter and monitor intake and output. cover the patient with blankets to ease chills, and explain what shappening. deliver supplemental oxygen at low flow rates through a nasal cannula orbag-valve-mask (handheld resuscitation bag). give drugs as ordered: an I.V. antihypotensive drug (like dopamine) andnormal saline solution to combat shock, epinephrine to treat dyspnea andwheezing, diphenhydramine to combat cellular histamine released frommast cells, corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, and mannitol orfurosemide to increase renal blood flow ensure 30 to 100 m L/hour of",10,110
888,"urine output. Administer parenteral antihistamines and corticosteroids forallergic reactions. (Severe reactions such as anaphylaxis may requireepinephrine.) Administer antipyretics for nonhemolytic febrile reactionsand appropriate I.V. antibiotics for bacterial contamination. Treatment for TRALI usually requires aggressive respiratory support,which may include intubation and mechanical ventilation. Diuretics arenot effective because the underlying pathology involves microvascularinjury rather than fluid overload.Special Considerations Remember to fully document the transfusion reaction on the patient schart, noting the transfusion s duration, the amount of blood absorbed, anda complete description of the reaction and of any interventions.HITE0 PREVENTION Make sure you know your hospital s policy about givingblood before you give a transfusion. Then make sure you have the rightblood and the right patient. Check and double-check the patient s name,hospital number, ABO blood group, and Rh status. If you find even a smalldiscrepancy, dont give the blood. Notify the blood bank immediately andretum the unopened unit.Autoimmunity RHEUMATOID ARTHRITISA chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease, RA primarily attacks peripheraljoints and surrounding muscles, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels.Spontaneous remissions and unpredictable exacerbations mark the course ofthis potentially crippling disease. RA usually requires lifelong treatment and,sometimes, surgery. In most patients, the disease follows an intermittentcourse and allows normal activity, although 10 suffer total disability fromsevere articular deformity, associated extra-articular symptoms, or both. Theprognosis worsens with the development of nodules, vasculitis, and hightiters of rheumatoid factor (RF).Causes and Incidence",14,91
889,"RA occurs worldwide, striking three times more females than males.Although it can occur at any age, it begins most often between ages 25 and55. This disease affects more than 7 million people in the United Statesalone.What causes the chronic inflammation characteristic of RA isn t known,but various theories point to infectious, genetic, and endocrine factors.Pathophysiology It s believed that a genetically susceptible individual develops abnormal oraltered Ig G antibodies when exposed to an antigen. This altered Ig G antibodyisn t recognized as self, and the individual forms an antibody against it an antibody known as RF. By aggregating into complexes, RF generatesinflammation. Eventually, cartilage damage by inflammation triggersadditional immune responses, including activation of complement. This intum attracts polymorphonuclear leukocytes and stimulates release ofinflammatory mediators, which enhance joint destruction.If unarrested, the inflammatory process within the joints occurs in fourstages. First, synovitis develops from congestion and edema of the synovialmembrane and joint capsule. Formation of pannus thickened layers ofgranulation tissue marks the second stage s onset. Pannus covers andinvades cartilage and eventually destroys the joint capsule and bone.Progression to the third stage is characterized by fibrous ankylosis fibrousinvasion of the pannus and scar formation that occludes the joint space. Boneatrophy and malalignment cause visible deformities and disrupt thearticulation of opposing bones, causing muscle atrophy and imbalance, and,possibly, partial dislocations or subluxations. In the fourth stage, fibroustissue calcifies, resulting in bony ankylosis and total immobility.

891,"Signs and Symptoms RA usually develops insidiously and initially produces nonspecific signs andsymptoms, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, persistent low-grade fever,weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and vague articular symptoms. Later, morespecific localized articular symptoms develop, commonly in the fingers at theproximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, and metatarsophalangealjoints. These symptoms usually occur bilaterally and symmetrically and mayextend to the wrists, knees, hips, elbows, and ankles. The affected jointsstiffen after inactivity, especially on rising in the moming. The fingers mayassume a spindle shape from marked edema and joint congestion. The jointsbecome tender and painful, at first only when the patient moves them, buteventually even at rest. They commonly feel hot to the touch. Ultimately, jointfunction is diminished.Deformities are common if active disease continues. Proximalinterphalangeal joints may develop flexion deformities or becomehyperextended. Metacarpophalangeal joints may swell dorsally, and volarsubluxation and stretching of tendons may pull the fingers to the ulnar side( ulnar drift ). The fingers may become fixed in a characteristic swan sneck appearance, or boutonniere deformity. The hands appearforeshortened, the wrists boggy; carpal tunnel syndrome from synovialpressure on the median nerve causes tingling paresthesia in the fingers.The most common extra-articular finding is the gradual appearance ofrheumatoid nodules subcutaneous, round or oval, nontender masses usually on pressure areas such as the elbows. Vasculitis can lead to skinlesions, leg ulcers, and multiple systemic complications. Peripheralneuropathy may produce numbness or tingling in the feet or weakness andloss of sensation in the fingers. Stiff, weak, or painful muscles are common.Other common extra-articular effects include pericarditis, pulmonary nodulesor fibrosis, pleuritis, scleritis, and episcleritis.Another complication is destruction of the odontoid process, part of thesecond cervical vertebra. Rarely, cord compression may occur, particularlyin patients with long-standing deforming disease. Upper motor neuron signsand symptoms, such as a positive Babinski sign and muscle weakness, mayalso develop.RA can also cause temporomandibular joint disease, which impairschewing and causes earaches. Other extra-articular findings may include",18,121
892,"infection, osteoporosis, myositis, cardiopulmonary lesions,lymphadenopathy, and peripheral neuritis.Diagnosis Typical clinical features suggest this disorder, but a definitive diagnosis isbased on laboratory and other test results: X-rays in early stages, show bone demineralization and soft-tissueswelling; later, loss of cartilage and narrowing of joint spaces; finally,cartilage and bone destruction and erosion, subluxations, and deformities RF test positive in 75 to 80 of patients, as indicated by a titer of1:160 or higher Synovial fluid analysis reveals increased volume and turbidity butdecreased viscosity and complement (C3 and C4) levels; WBC countusually exceeds 10,000/u L ESR elevated in 85 to 90 of patients (may be useful to monitorresponse to therapy because elevation commonly parallels diseaseactivity) CBC usually reveals moderate anemia and slight leukocytosis A C-reactive protein test may be positive and can help monitor responseto therapy. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test results may also be positive.The criteria for classifying RA developed by the American College of Rheumatology can also serve as guidelines for establishing a diagnosis.However, keep in mind that failure to meet these criteria particularly earlyin the disease doesn t exclude the diagnosis. (See Classifying rheumatoidarthritis.)Classifying rheumatoid arthritis The criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology allowfor the classification of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Guidelines A patient who meets four of the seven criteria is classified as having RA.The patient must experience the first four criteria for at least 6 weeks,and a physician must observe the second through fifth criteria.",4,81

Other useful medicationsinclude NSAIDs (such as indomethacin, fenoprofen, and ibuprofen),antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine), penicillamine (not as commonly used),gold salts (not as commonly used), Tofacitinib, and corticosteroids(prednisone).

Arthrodesis sacrifices joint mobility for stability and painrelief. Synovectomy (removal of destructive, proliferating synovium, usuallyin the wrists, knees, and fingers) may halt or delay the course of this disease.Osteotomy (the cutting of bone or excision of a wedge of bone) can realignjoint surfaces and redistribute stresses.

Assoonas allowed, help the patient get out of bed and sit in a chair,keeping the weight on the unaffected side. When he s ready to walk,consult with the physical therapist for walking instruction and aids.Special Considerations Assess all joints carefully. Look for deformities, contractures, immobility,and inability to perform everyday activities.Monitor the patient s vital signs and note weight changes, sensorydisturbances, and level of pain. Administer analgesics as ordered andwatch for adverse effects. Provide meticulous skin care. Check for rheumatoid nodules as well aspressure ulcers and breakdowns due to immobility, vascular impairment,corticosteroid treatment, or improper splinting. Use lotion or cleansingoil, not soap, for dry skin. Explain all diagnostic tests and procedures. Tell the patient to expectmultiple blood samples to allow firm diagnosis and accurate monitoringof therapy. Monitor the duration, not the intensity, of moming stiffness becauseduration more accurately reflects the disease s severity. Encourage thepatient to take hot showers or baths at bedtime or in the moming to reducethe need for pain medication. Apply splints carefully and correctly. Observe for pressure ulcers if thepatient is in traction or wearing splints.",19,104
903,"Explain the nature of the disease. Make sure the patient and familyunderstand that RA is a chronic disease that requires major changes inlifestyle. Emphasize that there are no miracle cures, despite claims to thecontrary.Encourage a balanced diet, but make sure the patient understands thatspecial diets won t cure RA. Stress the need for weight control becauseobesity adds further stress to joints.Urge the patient to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), such aspracticing good hygiene and dressing and feeding oneself. Suggest ADLaids, such as a long-handled shoehom; elastic shoelaces; zipper-pulls;button hooks; easy-to-handle cups, plates, and silverware; elevated toiletseats; and battery-operated toothbrushes. Household cleaning devicessuch as long-handled dustpans are also available. Patients who havetrouble maneuvering fingers into gloves should wear mittens.ADLs that can be done in a sitting position should be encouraged. Allowthe patient enough time to calmly perform these tasks.Provide emotional support. Remember that the patient with chronic illnesseasily becomes depressed, discouraged, and irritable. Encourage thepatient to discuss fears conceming dependency, sexuality, body image, andself-esteem. Refer the patient to an appropriate social service agency asneeded.Discuss sexual aids: altemative positions, pain medication, and moist heatto increase mobility.Before discharge, make sure the patient knows how and when to takeprescribed medication and how to recognize possible adverse effects.Teach the patient how to stand, walk, and sit correctly: upright and erect.Tell the patient to sit in chairs with high seats and armrests; the patientwill find it easier to get up from a chair if the knees are lower than thehips. If the patient doesn t own a chair with a high seat, recommendputting blocks of wood under a favorite chair s legs. Suggest an elevatedtoilet seat.Mobility aids are very helpful. Many medical and commercial stores offerassistive and supportive devices that promote self-care, including anoverhead grasping trapeze to get out of bed, easy-to-open drawers,handheld shower nozzles, handrails, and grab bars.Instruct the patient to pace daily activities, resting for 5 to 10 minutes outof each hour and altemating sitting and standing tasks. Adequate sleep and",15,120
904,"correct sleeping posture are important. The patient should sleep on theirback on a firm mattress and should avoid placing a pillow under theknees, which encourages flexion deformity.Teach the patient to avoid putting undue stress on joints and to use thelargest joint available for a given task, to support weak or painful jointsas much as possible, to avoid positions of flexion and promote positionsof extension, to hold objects parallel to the knuckles as briefly aspossible, to always use hands toward the center of the body, and to slide not lift objects whenever possible. Enlist the aid of the occupationaltherapist to teach how to simplify activities and protect arthritic joints.Stress the importance of shoes with proper support. Refer the patient to the Arthritis Foundation for more information oncoping with the disease. a ELDER TIP Reinforce safety precautions for elderly patients, such asthe removal of throw rugs and the use of handrails and adequatenight lighting. Recommend a step stool for elderly patients who need toreach in overhead cupboards. Suggest that the patient purchasemedication without safety caps, if available, because these caps can bedifficult to open. Medication administration should be designed to followa standard regimen that fits with the patient lifestyle.JUVENILE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITISAffecting children younger than age 16, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)is an inflammatory disorder of the connective tissues, characterized by jointswelling and pain or tendemess. It may also involve organs such as the skin,heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and eyes, producing extra-articular signs andsymptoms.JRA has three major types: systemic (Still disease or acute febrile type),polyarticular, and pauciarticular. Depending on the type, this disease canoccur as early as age 6 weeks although rarely before 6 months with peaksof onset at ages to 3 and 8 to 12.The prognosis for JRA is generally good, although disabilities can occur.Long periods of spontaneous remission are common. Improvement orremission may occur at puberty.Causes and Incidence",11,95
905,"The cause of JRA remains puzzling. Research continues to test severaltheories, such as those linking the disease to genetic factors or to anabnormal immune response. Viral or bacterial (particularly streptococcal)infection, trauma, and emotional stress may be precipitating factors, but theirrelationship to JRA remains unclear.Considered the major chronic rheumatic disorder of childhood, JRAaffects an estimated 50 to 100 per 100,000 children in the United States;overall incidence is twice as high in females, with variation among the typesof JRA.Pathophysiology The etiology and pathogenesis of JRA are not completely understood.Genetic susceptibility plays a major role, but there is significant overlapbetween loci associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and thoseassociated with other autoimmune diseases.Complications Ocular damage Loss of vision Growth disturbances Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms vary with the type of JRA. Affecting boys and girlsalmost equally, systemic JRA accounts for about 10 of cases. The affectedchildren may have mild, transient arthritis or frank polyarthritis with feverand rash. Joint involvement may not be evident at first, but the child sbehavior may clearly suggest joint pain. Such a child may constantly want tosit in a flexed position, may not walk much, or may refuse to walk at all.Young children with JRA are noticeably irritable and listless.Fever in systemic JRA occurs suddenly and spikes to 103 F (39.4 C) orhigher once or twice daily, usually in the late aftemoon, then rapidly retumsto normal or subnormal. (This sawtooth or intermittent spiking feverpattem helps differentiate JRA from other inflammatory disorders.) Whenfever spikes, an evanescent rheumatoid rash commonly appears, consisting ofsmall pale or salmon pink macules, usually on the trunk and proximalextremities and occasionally on the face, palms, and soles. Massaging or",10,89
906,"applying heat intensifies this rash. It s usually most conspicuous where theskin has been rubbed or subjected to pressure such as the areas of skincovered by underclothing.Other signs and symptoms of systemic JRA may __ includehepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, pleuritis, pericarditis, myocarditis,and nonspecific abdominal pain.Polyarticular JRA accounts for about 40 of cases and is three timesmore common in females than in males; affected children may beseronegative or seropositive for RF. It involves five or more joints andusually develops insidiously. Most commonly involved joints are the wrists,elbows, knees, ankles, and small joints of the hands and feet. Polyarticular JRA can also affect larger joints, including the temporomandibular joints,cervical spine, hips, and shoulders. These joints become swollen, tender, andstiff. Usually, the arthritis is symmetrical; it may be remittent or indolent. Thepatient may run a low-grade fever with daily peaks. Listlessness and weightloss can occur, possibly with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.Other signs of polyarticular JRA include subcutaneous nodules on the elbowsor heels and noticeable developmental retardation.Seropositive polyarticular JRA, the more severe type, usually occurs latein childhood and can cause destructive arthritis that mimics adult RA.Pauciarticular JRA involves few joints (usually no more than four),typically affecting the knees and other large joints. This form accounts for50 of cases and has major subtypes. The first, pauciarticular JRA withchronic iridocyclitis, most commonly strikes females younger than age 6 andinvolves the knees, elbows, ankles, or iris. Inflammation of the iris andciliary body is commonly asymptomatic but may produce pain, redness,blurred vision, and photophobia.The second subtype, pauciarticular JRA with sacroiliitis, usually strikesmales (9:1) older than age 8, who tend to test positive for human leukocyteantigen (HLA)-B27. This subtype is characterized by lower-extremityarthritis that produces hip, sacroiliac, heel, and foot pain as well as Achillestendinitis. These patients may later develop the sacroiliac and lumbararthritis characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis. Some also experience acuteiritis, but not as many as those with the first subtype.The third subtype includes patients with joint involvement who are ANAand HLA-B27 negative and don t develop iritis. These patients have a betterprognosis than those with the first or second subtype.",16,139
907,"Common to all types of JRA is joint stiffness in the moming or afterperiods of inactivity. Back pain and limited ROM are common. Growthdisturbances may also occur, resulting in uneven length of arms or legs due toovergrowth or undergrowth adjacent to inflamed joints.Diagnosis Persistent joint pain and the rash and fever clearly point to JRA. Laboratorytests are useful for ruling out other inflammatory or even malignant diseasesthat can mimic JRA. Disease activity and response to therapy can also bemonitored through laboratory results. CBC shows decreased Hb levels, neutrophilia, and thrombocytosis. ESR and C-reactive protein, haptoglobin, Ig, and C3 complement levelsmay be elevated. ANA test may be positive in patients who have pauciarticular JRA withchronic iridocyclitis. RF is present in 15 of JRA cases, compared with 85 of RA cases. Positive HLA-B27 antigens may forecast later development of ankylosingspondylitis. X-rays in early stages reveal changes, including soft-tissue swelling,effusion, and periostitis in affected joints. Later, osteoporosis andaccelerated bone growth may appear, followed by subchondral erosions,joint space narrowing, bone destruction, and fusion.Treatment Successful management of JRA usually involves administration of anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, carefully planned nutrition andexercise, and regular eye examinations. Both child and parents must beinvolved in therapy.NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologicagents, and corticosteroids are classifications of medications that may beused in treatment. Because of adverse effects, steroids are generally reservedfor treatment of systemic complications, such as pericarditis or iritis, that areresistant to NSAIDs. Corticosteroids and mydriatic drugs are commonly usedfor iridocyclitis. If little relief is obtained from these drugs, biologicresponse modifiers may be used. These drugs work by blocking variousactions of the inflammatory process.",17,112
908,"Physical therapy promotes regular exercise to maintain joint mobility andmuscle strength, thereby preventing contractures, deformity, and disability.Good posture, gait training, and joint protection are also beneficial. Splintshelp reduce pain, prevent contractures, and maintain correct joint alignment.Surgery is usually limited to soft-tissue releases to improve joint mobility.Joint replacement is delayed until the child has matured physically and canhandle vigorous rehabilitation.Special Considerations Parents and healthcare professionals should encourage the child to be asindependent as possible and to develop a positive attitude toward school,social development, and vocational planning. Regular slit-lamp examinations help ensure early diagnosis and treatmentof iridocyclitis. Children with pauciarticular JRA with chroniciridocyclitis should be checked every 3 months during periods of activedisease and every 6 months during remissions.PSORIATIC ARTHRITISPsoriatic arthritis is a rheumatoid-like joint disease associated withpsoriasis of nearby skin and nails. Although the arthritis component of thissyndrome may be clinically indistinguishable from RA, the rheumatoidnodules are absent, and serologic tests for RF are negative. Psoriatic arthritisis usually mild, with intermittent flare-ups, but in rare cases may progress tocrippling arthritis mutilans. This disease affects males and females equally;onset usually occurs between ages 30 and 35.Causes and Incidence Evidence suggests that predisposition to psoriatic arthritis is hereditary; 20 to 50 of patients are HLA-B27 positive. However, onset is usuallyprecipitated by streptococcal infection or trauma.About 5 to 8 of patients with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. Itoccurs in up to 1 of the general population.Signs and Symptoms Psoriatic lesions usually precede the arthritic component; however, after thefull syndrome is established, joint and skin lesions recur simultaneously.",9,96
909,"Arthritis may involve one joint or several joints symmetrically. Spinalinvolvement occurs in some patients. Peripheral joint involvement is mostcommon in the distal interphalangeal joints of the hands, which have acharacteristic sausagelike appearance. Nail changes include pitting,transverse ridges, onycholysis, keratosis, yellowing, and destruction. Thepatient may experience general malaise, fever, and eye involvement.Diagnosis Inflammatory arthritis in a patient with psoriatic skin lesions suggestspsoriatic arthritis. CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS X-rays confirm joint involvement and show: erosion of terminal phalangeal tufts whittling of the distal end of the terminal phalanges pencil-in-cup deformity of the distal interphalangeal joints relative absence of osteoporosis sacroiliitis atypical spondylitis with syndesmophyte formation. Hyperostosis andparavertebral ossification result, which may lead to vertebral fusion Blood studies indicate negative RF and elevated ESR and uric acid levels.Treatment In mild psoriatic arthritis, treatment is supportive and consists ofimmobilization through bed rest or splints, isometric exercises, paraffinbaths, heat therapy, and aspirin and other NSAIDs. Some patients respondwell to low-dose systemic corticosteroids; topical steroids may help controlskin lesions. DMARDs such as sulfasalazine and methotrexate therapy areeffective in treating both the articular and cutaneous effects of psoriaticarthritis. Antimalarials are contraindicated because they can provokeexfoliative dermatitis. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors such as adalimumab,etanercept, and infliximab block proteins in the inflammatory process,helping to reduce inflammation.Special Considerations Explain the disease and its treatment to the patient and family.",11,99
910,"Encourage exercise, particularly swimming, to maintain strength and ROM. Teach the patient how to apply skin care products and medicationscorrectly; explain possible adverse effects. Stress the importance of adequate rest and protection of affected joints. Encourage regular, moderate exposure to the sun. Refer the patient to the Arthritis Foundation for self-help and supportgroups.ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITISA chronic, usually progressive inflammatory disease, ankylosing spondylitisprimarily affects the sacroiliac, apophyseal, and costovertebral joints, alongwith adjacent soft tissue. The disease (also known as rheumatoid spondylitisand Marie Striimpell disease) usually begins in the sacroiliac joints andgradually progresses to the spine s lumbar, thoracic, and cervical regions.Deterioration of bone and cartilage can lead to fibrous tissue formation witheventual fusion of the spine or peripheral joints.Ankylosing spondylitis may be equally prevalent in both sexes.Progressive disease is well recognized in men, but the diagnosis iscommonly overlooked or missed in females, who tend to have moreperipheral joint involvement.Pathophysiology The pathophysiology remains quite unknown. However, new insights havebeen provided by the recent identification of susceptibility genes other than HLA-B27; evidence of a pivotal role for several proinflammatory cytokinesincluding IL-23 and IL-17; and the recognition that inflammation andstructural progression proceed separately from each other.Causes and Incidence Evidence strongly suggests a familial tendency in ankylosing spondylitis. Thepresence of HLA-B27 (positive in 90 of patients with this disease) andcirculating immune complexes suggests immunologic activity.One of 10,000 people has ankylosing spondylitis. It affects more malesthan females and usually emerges between ages 20 and 40, although it maydevelop in children younger than age 10.",9,92
911,"Complication Atlantoaxial subluxation Signs and Symptoms The first indication of ankylosing spondylitis is intermittent low back painthat s usually most severe in the moming or after a period of inactivity. Othersigns and symptoms depend on the disease stage and may include: hip deformity and associated limited ROM kyphosis in advanced stages, caused by chronic stooping to relievesymptoms mild fatigue, fever, anorexia, or weight loss; occasional iritis; aorticinsufficiency and cardiomegaly; and upper lobe pulmonary fibrosis(mimics tuberculosis) pain and limited expansion of the chest due to involvement of thecostovertebral joints peripheral arthritis involving shoulders, hips, and kneesstiffness and limited motion of the lumbar spine tendemess over the inflammation site These signs and symptoms progress unpredictably, and the disease can gointo remission, exacerbation, or arrest at any stage.Diagnosis Typical symptoms, family history, and the presence of HLA-B27 stronglysuggest ankylosing spondylitis.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Confirmation requires these characteristic X-ray findings: blurring of the bony margins of joints in the early stage bilateral sacroiliac involvement patchy sclerosis with superficial bony erosions eventual squaring of vertebral bodies bamboo spine with complete ankylosis ESR and alkaline phosphatase and serum Ig G A levels may be elevated. Anegative RF helps rule out RA, which produces similar symptoms.",3,80
912,"Treatment No treatment reliably stops progression of this disease, so management aimsto delay further deformity through good posture, stretching and deep-breathing exercises and, in some patients, braces and lightweight supports.Anti-inflammatory analgesics, such as aspirin, indomethacin, sulfasalazine,and sulindac, control pain and inflammation.Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have been shown to improve symptoms.Corticosteroid therapy or medication to suppress the immune system may beprescribed to control various symptoms. DMARDs such as methotrexate andsulfasalazine have been used in patients who don t respond well tocorticosteroids or those who are dependent on high doses of corticosteroids.Severe hip involvement usually necessitates surgical hip replacement.Severe spinal involvement may require a spinal wedge osteotomy to separateand reposition the vertebrae. This surgery is performed only on selectedpatients because of the risk of spinal cord damage and the longconvalescence involved.Special Considerations Ankylosing spondylitis can be an extremely painful and crippling disease, soyour main responsibility is to promote the patient s comfort. When dealingwith such a patient, keep in mind that limited ROM makes simple tasksdifficult. Offer support and reassurance. Administer medications as ordered. Apply local heat and providemassage to relieve pain. Assess mobility and degree of discomfortfrequently. Teach and assist with daily exercises as needed to maintainstrength and function. Stress the importance of maintaining good posture. If treatment includes surgery, provide good postoperative care. Becauseankylosing spondylitis is a chronic, progressively crippling condition, acomprehensive treatment plan should also reflect counsel from a socialworker, visiting nurse, and dietitian.To minimize deformities, advise the patient to: avoid any physical activity that places undue stress on the back, suchas lifting heavy objects stand upright; to sit upright in a high, straight chair; and to avoidleaning over a desk",12,101

Sjégren syndrome may be a primary disorder or itmay be associated with connective tissue disorders, such as RA,scleroderma, SLE, and polymyositis. In some patients, the disorder is limitedto the exocrine glands (glandular Sjégren syndrome); in others, it alsoinvolves other organs, such as the lungs and kidneys (extraglandular Sjégrensyndrome).Causes and Incidence The cause of Sjégren syndrome is unknown, but genetic and environmentalfactors probably contribute to its development. Viral or bacterial infection orperhaps exposure to pollen may trigger Sjégren syndrome in a geneticallysusceptible individual. Tissue damage results from infiltration bylymphocytes or from the deposition of immune complexes. Lymphocyticinfiltration may be classified as benign, malignant, or pseudolymphoma(nonmalignant, but tumorlike aggregates of lymphoid cells).This syndrome occurs mainly in females (90 of patents); mean age ofonset is 40 to 50.Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of Sjégren syndrome is not well understood. Thepresence of activated salivary gland epithelial cells expressing MHC class IImolecules and the identification of inherited susceptibility markers suggest",7,86
914,"that environmental or endogenous antigens trigger a_self-perpetuatinginflammatory response in susceptible individuals. In addition, the continuingpresence of active IFN pathways in Sjogren syndrome suggests ongoingactivation of the innate immune system. Together, these findings suggest anongoing interaction between the innate and acquired immune systems in Sj6gren syndrome.Complications Comeal ulceration Deafness Renal tubular necrosis Splenomegaly Signs and Symptoms About 50 of patients with Sjégren syndrome have confirmed RA and ahistory of slowly developing sicca complex. However, some patients seekmedical help for rapidly progressive and severe oral and ocular dryness, inmany cases accompanied by periodic parotid gland enlargement. Oculardryness (xerophthalmia) leads to foreign body sensation (gritty, sandy eye),redness, buming, photosensitivity, eye fatigue, itching, and mucoid discharge.The patient may also complain of a film across the field of vision.Oral dryness (xerostomia) leads to difficulty swallowing and talking;abnormal taste or smell sensation or both; thirst; ulcers of the tongue, buccalmucosa, and lips (especially at the comers of the mouth); and severe dentalcaries. Dryness of the respiratory tract leads to epistaxis, hoarseness, chronicnonproductive cough, recurrent otitis media, and increased incidence ofrespiratory infections.Other effects may include dyspareunia and pruritus (associated withvaginal dryness), generalized itching, fatigue, recurrent low-grade fever, andarthralgia or myalgia. Lymph node enlargement may be the first sign ofmalignant lymphoma or pseudolymphoma.Specific extraglandular findings in Sjégren syndrome include interstitialpneumonitis; interstitial nephritis, which results in renal tubular acidosis in25 of patients; Raynaud phenomenon (20 ); and vasculitis, usually limitedto the skin and characterized by palpable purpura on the legs (20 ). About",8,104
915,"50 of patients show signs of hypothyroidism related to autoimmune thyroiddisease. A few patients develop systemic necrotizing vasculitis.Diagnosis The diagnosis of Sjégren syndrome rests on the detection of two of thefollowing three conditions: xerophthalmia, xerostomia (with salivary glandbiopsy showing lymphocytic infiltration), and an associated autoimmune orlymphoproliferative disorder. Diagnosis must rule out other causes of oraland ocular dryness, including sarcoidosis, endocrine disorders, anxiety ordepression, and effects of therapy such as radiation to the head and neck.More than 200 commonly used drugs also produce dry mouth as an adverseeffect. In patients with salivary gland enlargement and severe lymphoidinfiltration, diagnosis must rule out cancer.Laboratory values include elevated ESR in most patients, mild anemia andleukopenia in 30 , and hypergammaglobulinemia in 50 . Autoantibodiesare also common, including anti-Sj6gren syndrome-A (anti-Ro) and anti-Sj6gren syndrome-B (anti-La), which are antinuclear and antisalivary ductantibodies. From 75 to 90 of patients test positive for RF; 90 , forantinuclear antibodies.Other tests help support this diagnosis. Schirmer tearing test and slit-lampexamination with rose Bengal dye are used to measure eye involvement.Salivary gland involvement is evaluated by measuring the volume of parotidsaliva and by secretory sialography and salivary scintigraphy. Lower-lipbiopsy shows salivary gland infiltration by lymphocytes.Treatment Treatment is usually symptomatic and includes conservative measures torelieve ocular or oral dryness. Mouth dryness can be relieved by using amethylcellulose swab or spray and by drinking plenty of fluids, especially atmealtime. Meticulous oral hygiene is essential, including regular flossing,brushing, at-home fluoride treatment, and frequent dental checkups.Instill artificial tears as often as every half hour to prevent eye damage(comeal ulcerations and comeal opacifications) from insufficient tearsecretions. Some patients may also benefit from instillation of an eyeointment at bedtime or from twice-a-day use of sustained-release cellulosecapsules (Lacrisert). If infection develops, antibiotics should be givenimmediately; topical steroids should be avoided. Other treatment measures",13,113
916,"vary with associated extraglandular findings. Parotid gland enlargementrequires local heat and analgesics. Pulmonary and renal interstitial diseasenecessitate corticosteroid use. Accompanying lymphoma is treated with acombination of chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation.Special Considerations Stress the need to humidify home and work environments to help relieverespiratory dryness. Advise the patient to avoid drugs that decrease saliva production, such asatropine derivatives, antihistamines, anticholinergics, and antidepressants. If mouth lesions make eating painful, suggest high-protein, high-calorieliquid supplements to prevent malnutrition. Advise the patient to avoid sugar, which contributes to dental caries.Tobacco; alcohol; and spicy, salty, or highly acidic foods, which causemouth irritation, should also be avoided. Suggest normal saline solution drops or aerosolized spray for nasaldryness. Advise the patient to avoid prolonged hot showers and baths and to usemoisturizing lotions to help ease dry skin. Suggest K-Y lubricating jelly asa vaginal lubricant. Suggest the use of sunglasses to protect the patient s eyes from dust, wind,and strong light. Moisture chamber spectacles may also be helpful.Because dry eyes are more susceptible to infection, advise the patient tokeep the face clean and to avoid rubbing the eyes. Refer the patient to the Sjégren s syndrome Foundation for additionalinformation and support.LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUSA chronic inflammatory disorder of the connective tissues, lupuserythematosus appears in two forms. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE)affects only the skin. (See Discoid lupus erythematosus.) SLE affectsmultiple organ systems as well as the skin and can be fatal. (See Organsaffected by systemic lupus erythematosus, page 416.) Like RA, SLE ischaracterized by recurring remissions and exacerbations, especially commonduring the spring and summer. The prognosis improves with early detection",19,101
917,"and treatment, but remains poor for patients who develop cardiovascular,renal, or neurologic complications or severe bacterial infections.Discoid lupus erythematosus Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a form of lupus erythematosusmarked by chronic skin eruptions that, if untreated, can lead to scarringand permanent disfigurement. About 1 of 20 patients with DLE laterdevelops systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The exact cause of DLE isunknown, but some evidence suggests an autoimmune defect. Anestimated 60 of patients with DLE are women in their late 20s or older.This disease is rare in children.DLE lesions are raised, red, scaling plaques, with follicular pluggingand central atrophy. The raised edges and sunken centers give them acoinlike appearance. Although these lesions can appear anywhere on thebody, they usually erupt on the face, scalp, ears, neck, and arms or on anypart of the body that s exposed to sunlight. Such lesions can resolvecompletely or may cause hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation,atrophy, and scarring. Facial plaques sometimes assume the butterflypattem characteristic of SLE. Hair tends to become brittle or may fall outin patches.As a rule, patient history and the appearance of the rash itself arediagnostic. Lupus erythematosus cell test is positive in fewer than 10 ofpatients. Skin biopsy of lesions reveals immunoglobulins or complementcomponents. SLE must be ruled out.Patients with DLE should avoid prolonged exposure to the sun,fluorescent lighting, or reflected sunlight. They should wear protectiveclothing, use sunscreening agents, avoid engaging in outdoor activitiesduring periods of most intense sunlight (between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.), andreport any changes in the lesions. Drug treatment consists of topical,intralesional, or systemic medication, as in SLE.Organs affected by systemic lupus erythematosus",14,101

920,"m tw Causes and Incidence The exact cause of SLE remains a mystery, but evidence points to interrelatedimmunologic, environmental, hormonal, and genetic factors. Autoimmunity isthought to be the prime causative mechanism.Certain predisposing factors may make a person susceptible to SLE.Physical or mental stress, streptococcal or viral infections, exposure tosunlight or ultraviolet light, immunization, pregnancy, and abnormal estrogenmetabolism may all affect this disease s development.SLE may also be triggered or aggravated by treatment with certain drugs for example, procainamide, hydralazine, anticonvulsants, and, lesscommonly, penicillins, sulfa drugs, and hormonal contraceptives.SLE strikes 9 times more women than men, increasing to 15 times moreduring childbearing years. It occurs worldwide but is most prevalent among Asians and Blacks.Pathophysiology Autoimmunity is felt to be the culprit. In autoimmunity, the body producesantibodies against its own cells, such as the ANA. The formed antigen-antibody complexes can suppress the body s normal immunity and damagetissues. Patients with SLE produce antibodies against many different tissuecomponents, such as RBCs, neutrophils, platelets, lymphocytes, or almostany organ or tissue in the body.Complications Pleurisy Pleural effusions Pneumonitis Pulmonary hypertension Pericarditis Endocarditis Coronary atherosclerosis",6,79
921,"Renal failure Signs and Symptoms The onset of SLE may be acute or insidious and produces no characteristicclinical pattem. However, its symptoms commonly include fever, weightloss, malaise, and fatigue as well as rashes and polyarthralgia. SLE mayinvolve every organ system. In 90 of patients, joint involvement is similarto that in RA. Skin lesions are most commonly erythematous rashes in areasexposed to light. The classic butterfly rash over the nose and cheeks occursin fewer than 50 of the patients. (See Butterfly rash.) Ultraviolet rays oftenprovoke or aggravate skin eruptions. Vasculitis can develop (especially inthe digits), possibly leading to infarctive lesions, necrotic leg ulcers, ordigital gangrene. Raynaud phenomenon appears in about 20 of patients.Patchy alopecia and painless ulcers of the mucous membranes are common.Butterfly rash In the classic butterfly rash, lesions appear on the cheeks and the bridgeof the nose, creating a characteristic butterfly pattem. The rash may varyin severity from malar erythema to discoid lesions (plaque).",11,61
922,"Constitutional symptoms of SLE include aching, malaise, fatigue, low-grade or spiking fever, chills, anorexia, and weight loss. Lymph nodeenlargement (diffuse or local, and nontender), abdominal pain, nausea,vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation may occur. Females may experienceirregular menstrual periods or amenorrhea during the active phase of SLE.About 50 of SLE patients develop signs of cardiopulmonaryabnormalities, such as pleuritis, pericarditis, and dyspnea. Myocarditis,endocarditis, tachycardia, parenchymal infiltrates, and pneumonitis mayoccur. Renal effects may include hematuria, proteinuria, urine sediment, andcellular casts, which may progress to total kidney failure. Urinary tractinfections may result from heightened susceptibility to infection. Seizure",7,49
923,"disorders and mental dysfunction may indicate neurologic damage. Centralnervous system (CNS) involvement may produce emotional instability,psychosis, and organic mental syndrome. Headaches, irritability, anddepression are common. (See Signs of systemic lupus erythematosus, page417.)Signs of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is difficult because SLEcommonly mimics other diseases; symptoms may be vague and varygreatly from patient to patient.The revised criteria for SLE must include four or more of thefollowing signs:abnormal titer of antinuclear antibodyhemolytic disordermalar rashdiscoid rasharthritisoral ulcerationsphotosensitivityserositisrenal disordemeurologic disorderimmunologic disorder He th6Uh/Oermh UC Oh UC HOCh UC(COCmh UC( C ODmh UC C Hh C Hh 72HDiagnosis Diagnostic tests for patients with SLE include a CBC with differential (forsigns of anemia and decreased WBC count); platelet count (may bedecreased); ESR (commonly elevated); and serum electrophoresis (mayshow hypergammaglobulinemia).Specific tests for SLE include:ANA panel, including anti-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and anti-Smithantibodies generally positive for lupus alone. (Because the anti-DNAtest is rarely positive in other conditions, it s the most specific test for SLE. However, if the patient is in remission, anti-DNA may be reduced or",7,63

Such patients are prone to antiphospholipid syndrome(thrombosis and thrombocytopenia).Treatment Patients with mild disease require little or no medication. NSAIDs, includingaspirin, control arthritis symptoms in many patients. Skin lesions needtopical treatment. Corticosteroid creams are recommended for acute lesions.Refractory skin lesions are treated with intralesional corticosteroids orantimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine. Because hydroxychloroquine cancause retinal damage, such treatment requires ophthalmologic examinationevery 6 months.Corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice for systemic symptoms of SLE, for acute generalized exacerbations, or for serious disease related tovital organ systems, such as pleuritis, pericarditis, lupus nephritis, vasculitis,and CNS involvement. Initial doses equivalent to 60 mg or more ofprednisone often bring noticeable improvement within 48 hours. As soon assymptoms are under control, steroid dosage is tapered slowly. (Rising serumcomplement levels and decreasing anti-DNA titers indicate patientresponse.) Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, a major complication of SLE, requires treatment with large doses of steroids. If renal failure occurs,dialysis or kidney transplant may be necessary. In some patients, cytotoxicdrugs may delay or prevent deteriorating renal status. Antihypertensive drugsand dietary changes may also be warranted in renal disease. Antimalarialsare helpful in treating skin, musculoskeletal, and systemic effects. For more",17,109
925,"serious cases of SLE, immunosuppressants may aid patients who have notresponded to other drugs.The photosensitive patient should wear protective clothing (hat,sunglasses, long sleeves, and slacks) and use a screening agent, with a sunprotection factor of at least 15, when outdoors. Because SLE usually strikesfemales of childbearing age, questions about pregnancy commonly arise.Available evidence indicates that a woman with SLE can have a safe,successful pregnancy if the patient has no serious renal or neurologicimpairment.Special Considerations Careful assessment, supportive measures, emotional support, and patienteducation are all important parts of the care plan for patients with SLE. Watch for constitutional symptoms: joint pain or stiffness, weakness,fever, fatigue, and chills. Observe for dyspnea, chest pain, and any edemaof the extremities. Note the size, type, and location of skin lesions. Checkurine for hematuria, scalp for hair loss, and skin and mucous membranesfor petechiae, bleeding, ulceration, pallor, and bruising. Provide a balanced diet. Renal involvement may mandate a low-sodium,low-protein diet. Urge the patient to get plenty of rest. Schedule diagnostic tests andprocedures to allow adequate rest. Explain all tests and procedures. Tellthe patient that several blood samples are needed initially, thenperiodically, to monitor progress. Apply heat packs to relieve joint pain and stiffness. Encourage regularexercise to maintain full ROM and prevent contractures. Teach ROMexercises as well as body alignment and postural techniques. Arrange forphysical therapy and occupational counseling as appropriate. Explain the expected benefit of prescribed medications. Watch foradverse effects, especially when the patient is taking high doses ofcorticosteroids. Advise the patient receiving cyclophosphamide to maintain adequatehydration. If prescribed, give mesna to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis andondansetron to prevent nausea and vomiting. Monitor vital signs, intake and output, weight, and laboratory reports.Check pulse rates and observe for orthopnea. Check stools and GI",22,117

Assess for signs of neurologic damage: personality change, paranoid orpsychotic behavior, ptosis, or diplopia. Take seizure precautions. If Raynaud phenomenon is present, warm and protect the patient s hands andfeet. Offer cosmetic tips such as suggesting the use of hypoallergenic makeupand refer the patient to a hairdresser who specializes in scalp disorders. Advise the patient to purchase medications in quantity, if possible. Wamagainst miracle drugs for relief of arthritis symptoms. Refer the patient to the Lupus Foundation of America and the Arthritis Foundation as needed.FIBROMYALGIA SYNDROMEFibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), previously called fibrositis, is a diffuse painsyndrome and one of the most common causes of chronic musculoskeletalpain. It s characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain, daily fatigue, andpoor-quality sleep, along with multiple tender points on examination (inspecific areas). More women than men are affected, and although FMS mayoccur at almost any age, the peak incidence is in patients between ages 20and 60.FMS has also been reported in children, who have more diffuse pain and ahigher incidence of sleep disturbances than adult patients. They may havefewer tender points and typically improve after 2 to 3 years of follow-up.Causes and Incidence The cause of FMS is unknown, but it may be a primary disorder or occur inassociation with an underlying disease, such as SLE, RA, osteoarthritis, andsleep apnea syndrome.The pain is located mainly in muscle areas, but no distinct abnormalitieshave been documented on microscopic evaluation of biopsies of tenderpoints when compared with normal muscle. One theory suggests that bloodflow to the muscle is decreased (because of poor muscle aerobicconditioning, rather than other physiologic abnormalities); another suggestscerebral blood flow in the thalamus and caudate nucleus is decreased,leading to a lowered pain threshold. Still other theories suggest that the cause",14,101
927,"lies in endocrine dysfunction, such as abnormal pituitary adrenal axisresponses, or in abnormal levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in braincenters, which affect pain and sleep. Abnormal functioning of other pain-processing pathways may also be involved.Considerable overlap of symptoms with other pain syndromes, such aschronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), raises the question of association withmicrobial infection, such as parvovirus B19.The development of FMS may be multifactorial and influenced by stress(physical and mental), physical conditioning, poor-quality sleep,neuroendocrine factors, psychiatric factors, and possibly, hormonal factors(explaining the predominance in women).Pathophysiology Fibromyalgia is currently understood to be a disorder of central painprocessing or a syndrome of central sensitivity. Research has providedevidence for altered functional connectivity and chemistry in the pain-processing system of the brain.Complications Mental fog Constant pain Fatigue Lack of sleep Depression Death from suicide or injury Signs and Symptoms The primary symptom is diffuse, dull, aching pain that s typicallyconcentrated across the neck and shoulders as well as in the lower back andproximal limbs. It can involve all body quadrants (bilateral upper trunk andarms, and bilateral lower trunk and legs) and typically is worse in themoming, when it s associated with stiffness. The pain can vary from day today and can be exacerbated by stress, lack of sleep, weather changes, andinactivity.Sleep disturbance and fatigue are commonly reported. The patientawakens feeling fatigued and remains so throughout the day. Fatigue is",7,82
928,"commonly present from a half hour to several hours after rising in themoming and can last for the rest of the day.Other associated features that can occur with FMS include irritable bowelsyndrome, tension headaches, puffy hands (sensation of hand swelling,especially in the moming), and paresthesia.Diagnosis FMS is diagnosed in a patient with characteristic symptoms, multiple tenderpoints on examination, and exclusion of other illnesses that can cause similarfeatures. Tender points are elicited by applying a moderate amount ofpressure to specific locations. This examination can be fairly subjective, butmany FMS patients with true tender points wince or withdraw when pressureis applied at a certain intensity. Nontender control points can also be testedto assess for conversion reactions (psychogenic rheumatism), in whichpatients hurt everywhere or exhibit other psychosomatic illnesses. (See Tender points of fibromyalgia.)Tender points of fibromyalgia The patient with fibromyalgia may report specific areas of tendemess.These areas are indicated in the illustrations below.",6,45

Antidepressants such as duloxetine and milnacipran may beused to lessen pain and fatigue. Antiseizure drugs, including gabapentin andpregabalin, may aid in reducing fibromyalgia pain.A physical therapist may assist in the management of FMS through the useof education, injection of tender points, massage therapy, and ultrasoundtreatments for particular problem areas. In a few studies, acupuncture,phototherapy, and mind-body exercises (such as yoga and tai chi) have beensomewhat beneficial.",5,48
930,"Special Considerations The most important aspect of FMS management is patient education.Patients must understand that although FMS pain can be severe and isoften chronic, the syndrome is common and doesn t lead to deforming orlife-threatening complications. A regular, low-impact aerobic exercise can be effective in improving thepatient s muscle conditioning, energy level, and overall sense of well-being. The FMS patient should be taught preexercise and postexercisestretching to minimize injury. Strongly encourage a low-intensity exerciseprogram, such as walking, bicycling, or swimming, and to increase levelof intensity as tolerated.GOODPASTURE SYNDROMEIn Goodpasture syndrome, hemoptysis and _ rapidly progressiveglomerulonephritis follow the deposition of antibody against the alveolar andglomerular basement membrane (GBM). The prognosis improves withaggressive immunosuppressive and antibiotic therapy along with dialysis orrenal transplantation.Causes and Incidence The cause of Goodpasture syndrome is unknown. Although some cases havebeen associated with exposure to hydrocarbons or type 2 influenza, manyhave no precipitating events. The high incidence of HLA DRW2 in thesepatients suggests a genetic predisposition.This syndrome may occur at any age but is most common in men betweenages 20 and 30. A second peak incidence occurs between ages 50 and 70,with men and women in this age group affected equally.Pathophysiology Abnormal production and deposition of antibody against GBM and alveolarbasement membrane activate the complement and inflammatory responses,resulting in glomerular and alveolar tissue damage.Complications Renal failure",8,87
931,"Pulmonary edema and hemorrhage Signs and Symptoms Goodpasture syndrome may initially cause malaise, fatigue, and pallorassociated with severe iron deficiency anemia. Pulmonary findings rangefrom slight dyspnea and cough with blood-tinged sputum to hemoptysis andfrank pulmonary hemorrhage. Subclinical pulmonary bleeding may precedeovert hemorrhage and renal disease by months or years. Usually, renalfindings are subtler, although some patients note hematuria and peripheraledema.Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Confirmation of Goodpasture syndromerequires measurement of circulating anti-GBM antibody byradioimmunoassay and linear staining of GBM and alveolar basementmembrane by immunofluorescence.Immunofluorescence of alveolar basement membrane shows lineardeposition of Ig as well as complement 3 and fibrinogen.Immunofluorescence of GBM also shows linear deposition of Ig combinedwith detection of circulating anti-GBM antibody. This finding distinguishes Goodpasture from other pulmonary-renal syndromes, such as Wegenergranulomatosis, polyarteritis, and SLE.A lung biopsy reveals interstitial and intra-alveolar hemorrhage withhemosiderin-laden macrophages. Chest X-ray reveals pulmonary infiltratesin a diffuse, nodular pattem, and renal biopsy commonly shows focalnecrotic lesions and cellular crescents.Creatinine and BUN levels typically increase two to three times normal.Urinalysis may reveal RBCs and cellular casts, which typify glomerularinflammation. Granular casts and proteinuria may also be observed.Treatment Treatment aims to remove antibody by plasmapheresis and to suppressantibody production with immunosuppressive drugs, such ascyclophosphamide, to stop attacks by immune cells on the kidneys and lungs.Patients with renal failure may benefit from dialysis or transplantation.",7,95
932,"Aggressive ultrafiltration helps relieve pulmonary edema that may aggravatepulmonary hemorrhage. High-dose IV. steroids also help control pulmonaryhemorrhage.Special Considerations Promote adequate oxygenation by elevating the bed s head andadministering humidified oxygen. Encourage the patient to conserve theirenergy. Assess respirations and breath sounds regularly; note sputumquantity and quality.Monitor vital signs, ABGs, hematocrit, and coagulation studies. Transfuse blood and administer steroids as ordered. Observe closely fordrug adverse effects. Assess renal function by monitoring symptoms, intake and output, dailyweights, creatinine clearance, and BUN and creatinine levels. Tell the patient and the family what signs and symptoms to expect and howto relieve them. Carefully describe other treatment measures such asdialysis.REACTIVE ARTHRITISA self-limiting syndrome associated with polyarthritis (dominant feature),urethritis, balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis), conjunctivitis, andmucocutaneous lesions, reactive arthritis (Re A), previously known as Reitersyndrome, appears to be related to infection, either venereal or enteric.Causes and Incidence The cause of Re A is unknown, but most cases follow venereal or entericinfection. Because 75 to 85 of patients with Re A test positive for the HLA-B27, genetic susceptibility is likely. Re A has followed infectionscaused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia, and Chlamydia organisms.This disease usually affects young males (ages 20 to 40); it s rare infemales and children. However, due to the uncertainty of diagnosis andvariations in the definition of this disorder, incidence is estimated atapproximately 3.5 per 100,000 people. About 1 to 3 of all patients withnonspecific urethritis develop an episode of arthritis.Pathophysiology",14,98
933,"Re A is usually triggered by a GU or GI infection. Evidence indicates that apreceding Chlamydia respiratory infection may also trigger Re A. Thefrequency of Re A after enteric infection averages 1 to 4 but variesgreatly, even among outbreaks of the same organism. Although severelysymptomatic GI infections are associated with an increased risk of Re A,asymptomatic venereal infections more frequently cause this disease.Complications Chronic heel pain Ankylosing spondylitis Persistent joint pain and swelling Signs and Symptoms The patient with Re A may complain of dysuria, hematuria, urgent andfrequent urination, and mucopurulent penile discharge, with swelling andreddening of the urethral meatus. Small painless ulcers may erupt on theglans penis (balanitis). These coalesce to form irregular patches that coverthe penis and scrotum. The patient may also experience suprapubic pain,fever, anorexia with weight loss, and other GU complications, such asprostatitis and hemorrhagic cystitis.Arthritic symptoms usually follow GU or enteric symptoms and last from 2to 4 months. Asymmetrical and extremely variable polyarticular arthritis ismost common, with a tendency to develop in weight-bearing joints of the legsand sometimes in the low back or sacroiliac joints. The arthritis is usuallyacute, with warm, erythematous, and painful joints, but it may be mild, withminimal synovitis. Muscle wasting is common near affected joints. Fingersand toes may swell and appear sausagelike.Ocular symptoms include mild bilateral conjunctivitis, possiblycomplicated by keratitis, iritis, retinitis, or optic neuritis. In severe cases,buming, itching, and profuse mucopurulent discharge are possible.In 30 of patients, skin lesions (keratoderma blennorrhagica) develop 4to 6 weeks after onset of other symptoms and may last for several weeks.These macular to hyperkeratotic lesions commonly resemble those ofpsoriasis. They usually occur on the palms and soles but can developanywhere on the trunk, extremities, or scalp. Nails become thick, opaque, and",13,110
934,"brittle; keratic debris accumulates under the nails. In many patients, painless,transient ulcerations erupt on the buccal mucosa, palate, and tongue.Diagnosis Nearly all patients with Re A test positive for HLA-B27 and have an elevated WBC count and ESR. Mild anemia may develop. Urethral discharge andsynovial fluid contain many WBCs, mostly polymorphonuclear leukocytes.Synovial fluid is high in complement and protein and is grossly purulent.Cultures of discharge and synovial fluid rule out other causes such asgonococci.During the first few weeks, X-rays are normal and may remain so, butsome patients may show osteoporosis in inflamed areas. If inflammationpersists, X-rays may show erosions of the small joints, periostealproliferation (new bone formation) of involved joints, and calcaneal spurs.Treatment No specific treatment exists for Re A. Most patients recover in 2 to 16 weeks.About 50 of patients have recurring acute attacks, whereas the rest followa chronic course, experiencing continued synovitis and sacroiltitis. In acutestages, limited weight bearing or complete bed rest may be necessary.Any underlying infection should be treated with antibiotics. Arthritis istreated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and pain relievers. Localadministration of corticosteroids may help relieve persistent inflammation inone joint. Physical therapy includes ROM and strengthening exercises and theuse of padded or supportive shoes to prevent contractures and footdeformities. Therapy to suppress the immune system may be considered insevere cases but is limited due to toxic adverse effects.Special Considerations Explain Re A. Discuss the medications and their possible adverse effects.Wam the patient to take medications with meals or milk to prevent GIbleeding. Encourage normal daily activity and moderate exercise. Suggest a firmmattress and encourage good posture and body mechanics. Arrange for occupational counseling if the patient has severe or chronicjoint impairment.",15,104

Eachclassification has distinctive forms.Systemic forms include: limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (or CREST syndrome) a benignform characterized by calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophagealdysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis characterized by generalized skinthickening and invasion of intemal organs systemic sine scleroderma a rare form of the disease, includesinvolvement of intemal organs but does not have skin involvement Localized forms include: morphea characterized by patchy skin changes with a droplikeappearance linear scleroderma characterized by a band of thickened skin on theface or extremities that severely damages underlying tissues, causingatrophy and deformity (most common in childhood)Other forms include chemically induced localized scleroderma,eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (recently associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan), toxic oil syndrome (associated with contaminated oil), andgraft-versus-host disease.Causes and Incidence The cause of scleroderma is unknown. Risk factors include exposure to silicadust and polyvinyl chloride.Scleroderma affects 300,000 people in the United States, more womenthan men, especially between ages 30 and 50. About 30 of patients withscleroderma die within 5 years of onset.",4,91
936,"Complications Arrhythmias Dyspnea Malignant hypertension Pathophysiology The pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis is complex. Increasing evidencesuggests an interaction between environmental and genetic factors, with aregulatory epigenetic mechanism involving changes in the expression of DNA and micro RNA.The clinical and pathologic manifestations result from three distinctprocesses: (1) severe fibroproliferative vascular lesions of small arteriesand arterioles, (2) excessive and often progressive deposition of collagenand other extracellular matrix macromolecules in skin and various intemalorgans, and (3) alterations in humoral and cellular immunity. It is not clearwhich of these processes is of primary importance or how they aretemporally related during the development and progression of the disease.Complications Compromised circulation due to thickened vessels Decreased food intake or weight loss due to GI symptoms Arrhythmias Dyspnea Malignant hypertension Signs and Symptoms Scleroderma typically begins with Raynaud phenomenon blanching,cyanosis, and erythema of the fingers and toes in response to stress orexposure to cold. Progressive phalangeal resorption may shorten the fingers.Compromised circulation, which results from abnormal thickening of thearterial intima, may cause slowly healing ulcerations on the tips of the fingersor toes that may lead to gangrene. Raynaud phenomenon may precedescleroderma by months or years.Later symptoms include pain, stiffness, and finger and joint swelling. Skinthickening produces taut, shiny skin over the entire hand and forearm. Facial",7,84
937,"skin also becomes tight and inelastic, causing a masklike appearance and pinching of the mouth. As tightening progresses, contractures may develop.GI dysfunction causes frequent reflux, heartbum, dysphagia, and bloatingafter meals. These symptoms may cause the patient to decrease food intakeand lose weight. Other GI effects include abdominal distention, diarrhea,constipation, and malodorous floating stools.Diagnosis Typical cutaneous changes provide the first clue to diagnosis. Results ofdiagnostic tests include: blood studies slightly elevated ESR, positive RF in 25 to 35 ofpatients, and positive ANA test chest X-rays bilateral basilar pulmonary fibrosis electrocardiogram possible nonspecific abnormalities related tomyocardial fibrosis GI X-rays distal esophageal hypomotility and stricture, duodenal loopdilation, small-bowel malabsorption pattem, and large diverticula hand X-rays terminal phalangeal tuft resorption, subcutaneouscalcification, and joint space narrowing and erosion pulmonary function studies decreased diffusion and vital capacity andrestrictive lung disease skin biopsy may show changes consistent with the disease s progress,such as marked thickening of the dermis and occlusive vessel changes urinalysis proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and casts (with renalinvolvement)Treatment Currently, no cure exists for scleroderma. Treatment aims to preserve normalbody functions and minimize complications. Use of an immunosuppressant isa common palliative measure. Corticosteroids, NSAIDs, cyclooxygenose-2inhibitors, and analgesics help to alleviate joint pain and stiffness.

939,"VASCULITISVasculitis includes a broad spectrum of disorders characterized byinflammation and necrosis of blood vessels. Its clinical effects, which reflecttissue ischemia caused by blood flow obstruction, and confirming laboratoryprocedures depend on the vessels involved. The prognosis is variable. Forexample, hypersensitivity vasculitis is usually a benign disorder limited tothe skin, but more extensive polyarteritis nodosa can be rapidly fatal.Vasculitis can occur at any age, except for mucocutaneous lymph nodesyndrome, which occurs only during childhood. Vasculitis may be a primarydisorder or occur secondary to other disorders, such as RA or SLE.Causes and Incidence How vascular damage develops in vasculitis isn t well understood. It hasbeen associated with a history of serious infectious disease, such as hepatitis B or bacterial endocarditis, and high-dose antibiotic therapy.Pathophysiology Current theory holds that it s initiated by excessive circulating antigen, whichtriggers the formation of soluble antigen-antibody complexes. Thesecomplexes can t be effectively cleared by the reticuloendothelial system, sothey re deposited in blood vessel walls (type III hypersensitivity). Increasedvascular permeability associated with the release of vasoactive amines byplatelets and basophils enhances such deposition. The deposited complexesactivate the complement cascade, resulting in chemotaxis of neutrophils,which release lysosomal enzymes. In tum, these enzymes cause vesseldamage and necrosis, which may precipitate thrombosis, occlusion,hemorrhage, and ischemia.Another mechanism that may contribute to vascular damage is the cell-mediated (T-cell) immune response. In this response, circulating antigentriggers the release of soluble mediators by sensitized lymphocytes, whichattracts macrophages. The macrophages release intracellular enzymes, whichcause vascular damage. They can also transform into the epithelioid andmultinucleated giant cells that typify the granulomatous vasculitides.Phagocytosis of immune complexes by macrophages enhances granulomaformation.",13,93

In dermatomyositis, such muscle weakness is accompanied bycutaneous involvement. These diseases usually progress slowly, withfrequent exacerbations and remissions. They occur in twice as many femalesas males (except dermatomyositis with malignant tumor, which is mostcommon in males older than age 40).The prognosis usually worsens with age. Death commonly occurs fromassociated cancer, respiratory disease, or heart failure or from the adverseeffects of drug therapy.

Othermuscular symptoms include inability to move against resistance, proximaldysphagia, dysphonia, and difficulty breathing.In dermatomyositis, an erythematous rash usually erupts on the face, neck,upper back, chest, and arms as well as around the nail beds. A characteristicheliotrope rash appears on the eyelids, accompanied by periorbital edema.Gottron papules (violet, flat-topped lesions) may appear on_ theinterphalangeal joints.Diagnosis",8,84
946,"CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis requires a muscle biopsy that showsnecrosis, degeneration, regeneration, and interstitial chroniclymphocytic infiltration. Magnetic resonance imaging and anelectrocardiogram, as well as the use of electromyography, aid indiagnosis.Other tests differentiate polymyositis from diseases that cause similarmuscular or cutaneous symptoms, such as muscular dystrophy, advancedtrichinosis, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and SLE.Typical laboratory results in polymyositis include elevated ESR, elevated WBC count, and elevated muscle enzyme levels (creatine kinase, aldolase,and serum aspartate aminotransferase) not attributable to hemolysis of RBCsor hepatic or other diseases. Other laboratory results include increased urinecreatine level ( 150 mg/24 hours), decreased creatinine level, and positiveantinuclear antibodies. Electromyography shows polyphasic short-durationpotentials, fibrillation (positive spike waves), and bizarre high-frequencyrepetitive changes.Treatment High-dose corticosteroid therapy relieves inflammation and lowers muscleenzyme levels. Within 2 to 6 weeks after treatment, serum muscle enzymelevels usually retum to normal, and muscle strength improves, permitting agradual tapering down of corticosteroid dosage. If the patient respondspoorly to corticosteroids, treatment may include cytotoxic orimmunosuppressant drugs. Supportive therapy includes bed rest during theacute phase, ROM exercises to prevent contractures, analgesics andapplication of heat to relieve painful muscle spasms, and diphenhydramine torelieve itching. Patients older than age 40 need thorough assessment forcoexisting cancer.Special Considerations Assess level of pain, muscle weakness, and ROM daily. Give analgesicsas needed. Ifthe patient is confined to bed, prevent pressure ulcers by giving goodskin care. To prevent footdrop and contractures, apply high-toppedsneakers, and assist with passive ROM exercises at least four times daily.Teach the patient s family how to perform these exercises on the patient.",11,108
947,"If 24-hour urine collection for creatine or creatinine is necessary, makesure your coworkers understand the procedure. When you assist withmuscle biopsy, make sure the biopsy isn t taken from an area of recentneedle insertion.If the patient has a rash, wam the patient not to scratch, as it may causeinfection. If antipruritic medication doesn t relieve severe itching, applytepid sponges or compresses. Encourage the patient to feed and dress to the best of their ability but toask for help when needed. Advise the patient to pace activities tocounteract muscle weakness. Encourage the patient to express anxiety.Ease the fear of dependence by reassuring the patient that muscleweakness is probably temporary. Explain the disease to the patient and family. Prepare them for diagnosticprocedures and possible adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy (weightgain, hirsutism, hypertension, edema, amenorrhea, purplish striae,glycosuria, acne, and easy bruising). Advise a low-sodium diet to preventfluid retention. Emphatically wam against abruptly discontinuingcorticosteroids. Reassure the patient that steroid-induced weight gain willdiminish when the drug is discontinued.Immunodeficiency AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIAAgammaglobulinemia is a recessive, congenital disorder in which all five Igs Ig M, Ig G, Ig A, Ig D, and Ig E and circulating B cells are absent ordeficient but T cells are intact. It s also called Bruton agammaglobulinemiaand X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Affecting males almost exclusively, thisdisorder causes severe, recurrent infections during infancy. Prognosis isgood with early treatment, except in infants who develop polio or persistentviral infection. Infection usually causes some permanent damage, especiallyin the neurologic or respiratory system.Causes and Incidence Humoral (B-cell) immune deficiencies account for 50 of all primaryimmunodeficiencies. Ig A deficiency is the most common antibody deficiency",16,99
948,"syndrome, followed by common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Theincidence of these two disorders is 1 in 700 persons. Selective Ig Mdeficiency is rare. Ig G4 deficiency occurs in 10 to 15 of the population.Pathophysiology B cells and B-cell precursors may be present in the bone marrow andperipheral blood, but a mutation in the B-cell protein tyrosine kinase keeps Bcells from maturing and secreting Ig. Without protective Igs, the affectedperson develops repeated infections.Complications Chronic otitis media Chronic sinusitis Encephalitis Failure to thrive Hepatitis Enteroviral infections Meningitis Signs and Symptoms Typically, the infant with agammaglobulinemia is asymptomatic until age 6months, when transplacental matemal Igs that provided immunity have beendepleted. The patient then develops recurrent bacterial otitis media,pneumonia, dermatitis, bronchitis, and meningitis usually caused bypneumococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, or other gram-negativeorganisms. Purulent conjunctivitis, abnormal dental caries, and polyarthritisresembling RA may also occur. Severe malabsorption associated withinfestation by Giardia lamblia may retard development. Despite recurrentinfections, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are usually absent.Diagnosis The diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia can be especially difficult becauserecurrent infections are common even in normal infants (many of whom don tstart producing their own antibodies until age 18 to 20 months).Immunoelectrophoresis and quantitative Igs (nephelometry) confirmdecreased levels, or a total absence, of Ig M, Ig A, and Ig G in the serum. Ig G",10,86
949,"is usually less than 200 mg/d L, and Ig A and Ig M are almost unmeasurable.However, diagnosis by this method usually isn t possible until the infant is 9months old. Antigenic stimulation confirms an inability to produce specificantibodies, although cellular immunity remains intact. Flow cytometry maybe helpful in measuring circulating B lymphocytes.Treatment Treatment aims to prevent or control infections and to boost the patient simmune response. Injection of immune serum globulin (gamma globulin, IVIg) helps maintain immune response. Because these injections are painful,give them deep into a large muscle mass, such as the gluteal or thigh muscles,and massage well. If the dosage is more than 1.5 m L, divide it and inject itinto more than one site; for frequent injections, rotate the injection sites.Because immune globulin is composed primarily of Ig G, the patient may alsoneed fresh frozen plasma infusions to provide Ig A and Ig M. Mucosalsecretory Ig A can t be replaced by therapy, resulting in crippling pulmonarydisease in many patients.The judicious use of antibiotics also helps combat infection; in somecases, chronic broad-spectrum antibiotics may be indicated. During acuteinfection, monitor the patient closely. Maintain adequate nutrition andhydration. Perform chest physiotherapy if required.Special Considerations Carefully explain all treatment measures, and make sure the patient andfamily understand the disorder. Teach the patient and family how to recognize early signs of infection andcounsel them to report such signs promptly. Advise them to have cuts andscrapes cleaned immediately. Wam them to avoid crowds and people whohave active infections. Advise parents that live-virus vaccines are contraindicated due to thepotential to cause infections.Suggest genetic counseling if parents have questions about vulnerability offuture offspring.COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNODEFICIENCY",13,90
950,"CVID is characterized by progressive deterioration of B-cell (humoral)immunity, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection.Causes and Incidence The cause of CVID is unknown.Unlike agammaglobulinemia, this disorder (also known as acquiredhypogammaglobulinemia) usually causes symptoms after infancy andchildhood, between ages 25 and 40. It affects males and females equally andusually doesn t interfere with normal life span or normal pregnancy andoffspring.Pathophysiology Most patients have a normal circulating B-cell count but defective synthesisor release of Igs. Many also exhibit progressive deterioration of T-cell (cell-mediated) immunity revealed by delayed hypersensitivity skin testing.Complications Conjunctivitis Chronic sinusitis Giardia lamblia GI infestation Upper and lower respiratory tract infections Encephalitis Meningitis Hemolytic anemia Signs and Symptoms In CVID, pyogenic bacterial infections are characteristic but tend to bechronic rather than acute (as in agammaglobulinemia). Recurrentsinopulmonary infections, chronic bacterial conjunctivitis, and malabsorption(associated with infestation by G. /amblia) are usually the first clues toimmunodeficiency.CVID may be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, RA,hemolytic anemia, and pemicious anemia, and with cancers, such asleukemia and lymphoma.Diagnosis",4,71
951,"Characteristic diagnostic markers in this disorder are decreased serum Ig(Ig M, Ig A, and Ig G) levels detected by immunoelectrophoresis, along with anormal circulating B-cell count. Antigenic stimulation confirms an inabilityto produce specific antibodies; cell-mediated immunity may be intact ordelayed. X-rays usually show signs of chronic lung disease or sinusitis.Treatment Treatment and care of patients with CVID are essentially the same as forthose with agammaglobulinemia.Injection of immune globulin (usually weekly to monthly) helps maintainthe immune response. Because these injections are painful, give them deepinto a large muscle mass, such as the gluteal or thigh muscles, and massagewell. If the dosage is more than 1.5 m L, divide the dose and inject it intomore than one site; for frequent injections, rotate the injection sites. Becauseimmune globulin is composed primarily of Ig G, the patient may also needfresh frozen plasma infusions to provide Ig A and Ig M.Antibiotics are the mainstay for combating infection. Regular X-rays andpulmonary function studies help monitor lung infection; chest physiotherapymay be ordered to forestall or help clear such infection.Special Considerations Teach the patient and family how to recognize early signs of infection andcounsel them to report such signs promptly. Advise the patient to avoidcrowds and people who have active infections. Stress the importance of good nutrition and regular follow-up care.IGA DEFICIENCYTotal absence or severe deficiency of Ig A, also known as selective Ig Adeficiency, is the most common primary Ig deficiency, appearing in as manyas 1 in 400 to 1,000 people. Ig A the major Ig in human saliva, nasal andbronchial fluids, and intestinal secretions guards against bacterial and viralreinfections. Consequently, Ig A deficiency leads to chronic sinopulmonaryinfections, allergies, chronic diarrhea, GI diseases, and other disorders. Theprognosis is good for patients who receive correct treatment, especially ifthey have no associated disorders.",12,101
952,"Causes and Incidence Ig A deficiency seems to be linked to autosomal dominant or recessiveinheritance. The disorder has familial trends and occurs frequently inimmediate relatives of individuals with CVID. Congenital intrauterineinfection with rubella, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus can result inselective Ig A deficiency. Treatment for seizures with phenytoin andhydantoin, as well as Wilson disease (an inherited disorder treated withpenicillamine), can result in temporarily acquired selective Ig A deficiency.When the medications are stopped, the Ig A level retums to normal. Somedrugs, such as anticonvulsants, may cause transient Ig A deficiency.Pathophysiology The presence of normal numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes carrying Ig A receptors and of normal amounts of other Igs suggests that B cells maynot be secreting Ig A, as they haven t matured into Ig A-producing plasmacells.Signs and Symptoms Some Ig A-deficient patients have no symptoms, possibly because they haveextra amounts of low molecular-weight Ig M. This Ig takes over Ig A functionand helps maintain immunologic defenses. Among patients who developsymptoms, chronic sinopulmonary infection is the most common. Othereffects are respiratory allergy, often triggered by infection; GI tract diseases,such as celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and regional enteritis; autoimmunediseases, such as RA, SLE, immunohemolytic anemia, and chronic hepatitis;and malignant tumors, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs,reticulum cell sarcoma, and thymoma.Age of onset varies. Some Ig A-deficient children with recurrentrespiratory disease and middle ear inflammation may begin to synthesize Ig Aspontaneously as recurrent infections subside and their condition improves.Diagnosis Serum immunoelectrophoresis and quantitative immunologic analyses ofpatients with Ig A deficiency show serum Ig A levels below 7 mg/d L.Although Ig A is usually absent from secretions in patients with Ig Adeficiency, levels may be normal in rare cases. Ig E is normal, whereas Ig M",9,106
953,"may be normal or elevated in serum and secretions. Normally absent low molecular-weight Ig M may be present.Tests may also indicate autoantibodies and antibodies against Ig G (RF),Ig M, and bovine milk. Cell-mediated immunity and secretory piece (theglycopeptide that transports Ig A) are usually normal, and most circulating Bcells appear normal.Treatment Selective Ig A deficiency has no known cure. Treatment aims to controlsymptoms of associated diseases, such as respiratory and GI infections, andis generally the same as for a patient with normal Ig A.ALERT Dont give an Ig A-deficient patient immune globulin (IV Ig)because sensitization may lead to anaphylaxis during futureadministration of blood products.If transfusion with blood products is necessary, minimize the risk ofadverse reaction by using washed RBCs or avoid the reaction completely bycrossmatching the patient s blood with that of an Ig A-deficient donor.Special Considerations Because this is a lifelong disorder, teach the patient to prevent infection, torecognize its early signs, and to seek treatment promptly.DIGEORGE SYNDROMEDi George syndrome (DGS), also called 22q//.2 deletion syndrome, is adisorder caused by a large deletion from chromosome 22. This deletionmeans that several genes from this region are not present in DGS patients.The variation in the symptoms of the disease appears to be related to theamount of genetic material lost in the chromosomal deletion. DGS can affecta few or many body systems. Problems that are commonly associated withthis syndrome include heart defects, cleft palate, and developmental andbehavioral disorders.In addition, some neonates may present with immunologic problems.Errors during fetal development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouchesinterfere with thymus formation; the thymus may be completely absent orpartially present in an abnormal location, causing deficient T-cell (cell-",7,89
954,"mediated) immunity. (See Role of the thymus in immune response.) As aresult, recurrent infections or difficulty with vaccinations may occur. Manychildren outgrow these problems by age 1 year. However, some continuewith problems throughout childhood and into adulthood. Theseimmunodeficiency problems include Graves disease, idiopathicthrombocytopenia, and juvenile arthritis.Role of the thymus in immune response The thymus provides an environment in which T cells develop and leamto distinguish self from nonself during fetal and early postnatal stages.Most cells that enter the thymus are destroyed. T-cell clones that reactstrongly to self and those that don t recognize self are deleted (negativeselection). T-cell clones that recognize self but don t react stronglyagainst self are positively selected.After early life, mature T cells reside primarily in peripheral lymphorgans and recirculate in blood and lymph.Causes and Incidence DGS is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome 22. This syndrome ispresent in 1 in 4,000 live births. It may also be found in in 68 children withcongenital heart defects, and 5 to 8 of children bom with a cleft palate.Pathophysiology The 22q11.2 deletion results in a range of embryonic developmentaldisruptions involving the head, neck, brain, skeleton, and kidneys. Portions ofthe heart, head and neck, thymus, and parathyroids derive from the third andfourth pharyngeal pouches, and this developmental field is disrupted due tothe chromosomal microdeletion. This, in tum, leads to hypocalcemia andvariable T-cell deficiency. A combined T- and B-cell deficiency in partresults from lack of T-helper cell function as seen in cases of complete22q11.2DS.Complications Hypocalcemia (life-threatening)",13,85
955,"Seizures CNS damage Failure to thrive Anorexia Diarrhea Weight loss Cardiac failure Signs and Symptoms Symptoms are usually obvious at birth or shortly thereafter. An infant with DGS may have low-set prominent ears, notched ear pinnae, a mouth withoutthe usual bow-shaped lip, an undersized jaw, and abnormally wide-set eyes(hypertelorism) that are low-set and posteriorly angulated. Additionally, aninfant may have a bifid uvula and a high, arched palate. Congenital heartanomalies are common. Cardiovascular abnormalities include great bloodvessel anomalies (these may also develop soon after birth) and tetralogy of Fallot.An infant with thymic hypoplasia (rather than aplasia) may experience aspontaneous retum of cell-mediated immunity but can develop severe T-celldeficiencies later in life. This allows exaggerated susceptibility to viral,fungal, or bacterial infections, which may be _ overwhelming.Hypoparathyroidism, usually associated with DGS, typically causes tetany,hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia (calcium levels 7mg/d L) develops early and is unusually resistant to treatment. It can lead totetany, seizures, CNS damage, and early heart failure.Diagnosis Immediate diagnosis is difficult unless the infant has typical facial anomalies normally the first clues to the disorder. A definitive diagnosis depends onsuccessful treatment of hypocalcemia and other life-threatening birth defectsduring the first few weeks of life. Such diagnosis rests on proof of decreasedor absent T lymphocytes (sheep cell test, lymphopenia), partial B-cellimmunodeficiency, and of an absent thymus (chest X-ray). Fluorescent in situhybridization test can reveal the chromosomal 22 deletion.Additional tests showing low serum calcium level, elevated serumphosphorus level, and missing parathyroid hormone confirmhypoparathyroidism.",11,93
956,"Treatment Vv ALERT Life-threatening hypocalcemia must be treated immediately,but it s unusually resistant and requires aggressive treatment, forexample, with rapid IV. infusion of a 10 solution of calcium gluconate.During such an infusion, monitor heart rate and watch carefully to avoidinfiltration. Remember that calcium supplements must be given with vitamin D, or sometimes also with parathyroid hormone, to ensure effective calciumutilization. After hypocalcemia is under control, a fetal thymus transplant orhematopoietic cell transplant may restore normal cell-mediated immunity.Cardiac anomalies require surgical repair when possible.Special Considerations Instruct the patient with DGS to follow a low-phosphorus diet, andeducate about measures to prevent infection. Teach the parents of an infant with DGS to watch for signs of infectionand have it treated immediately, to keep the infant away from crowds orany other potential sources of infection, and to provide good hygiene andadequate nutrition and hydration. Advise the parents to schedule and keep regular follow-up visits to theinfant s pediatrician.ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROMEAIDS is a serious secondary immunodeficiency disorder caused by thehuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Immunodeficiency makes the patientsusceptible to opportunistic infections, unusual cancers, and otherabnormalities. (See Common infections and neoplasms in HIV and AIDS,page 434.)Common infections and neoplasms in HIV and AIDSThis is a list of commonly seen disorders with human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Since then, the CDC has declared a case surveillancedefinition for AIDS and modified it several times, most recently in 2008.Causes and Incidence AIDS results from infection with HIV, which has two forms: HIV-1 and HIV-2. Both forms of HIV have the same modes of transmission and similaropportunistic infections associated with AIDS, but studies indicate that HIV-2 develops more slowly and presents with milder symptoms than HIV-1.",3,65
958,"Transmission occurs through contact with infected blood or body fluidsand is associated with identifiable high-risk behaviors. It sdisproportionately represented in: homosexual and bisexual men persons who use illicit I.V. drugs neonates of infected females recipients of contaminated blood or blood products (incidencedramatically decreased since mid-1985) heterosexual partners of persons in the former groups Pathophysiology The disease is characterized by the progressive destruction of cell-mediated(T-cell) immunity with subsequent effects on humoral (B-cell) immunitybecause of the pivotal role of the CD4 helper T cells in immune reactions.Complications Opportunistic infections Certain cancers Signs and Symptoms A person with HIV may remain asymptomatic for months or years. Initially,laboratory evidence of seroconversion to HIV antibodies may be the onlyclinical evidence of infection. However, as the disease progresses, thepatient may develop generalized adenopathy and nonspecific signs andsymptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and fevers. As thepatient s T-cell count lowers further, neurologic symptoms, opportunisticinfections, and certain normally rare cancers may develop. (See Manifestations of HIV infection and AIDS, page 435.) HIV also destroyslymph nodes and immunologic organs, leading to major dysfunctions of theimmunologic system. Eventually, HIV advances to AIDS.

Children show virtually all of the opportunisticinfections observed in adults, with a higher incidence of bacterialinfections: otitis media, pneumonias other than that caused by Pneumocystis carinii, sepsis, chronic salivary gland enlargement, andlymphoid interstitial pneumonia.Diagnosis CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Signs and symptoms may occur at any timeafter infection with HIV, but AIDS isnt officially diagnosed until thepatients CD4 T-cell count falls below 200 cells/u L or the associatedclinical conditions or disease are present.The most commonly performed tests, antibody tests, indicate HIV infectionindirectly by revealing HIV antibodies. The recommended protocol requiresinitial screening of individuals and blood products with an enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA). A positive ELISA should be repeated andthen confirmed by an altemate method, usually the Westem blot or animmunofluorescence assay. The radioimmunoprecipitation assay isconsidered more sensitive and specific than the Westem blot, but because itrequires radioactive materials, it s a poor choice for routine screening. Inaddition, antibody testing isn t reliable. Because people produce detectablelevels of antibodies at different rates a window varying from a fewweeks to as long as 35 months in one documented case an HIV-infectedperson can test negative for HIV antibodies. Antibody tests are alsounreliable in neonates because transferred matemal antibodies persist for 6to 10 months. To overcome these problems, direct tests are used, includingantigen tests (p24 antigen), HIV cultures, nucleic acid probes of peripheralblood lymphocytes, and the polymerase chain reaction.

Because many opportunistic infectionsin AIDS patients are reactivations of previous infections, patients are alsotested for associated neoplasms, infections, and STDs.Treatment",3,99
963,"There is no cure for either HIV or AIDS. However, significant advanceshave been made to help patients control signs and symptoms and impairdisease progression. Because HIV can become resistant to any drug,healthcare professionals use combination treatments and multiple drugregimens to suppress the virus. Patients receiving medication remaininfectious.An effective method of treatment is highly active antiretroviral therapy(HAART), which combines three or more anti-HIV medications in a dailyregimen. HAART aims to reduce the number of HIV particles in the blood asmeasured by viral load, thus increasing T-cell counts and improving theimmunologic system s functioning. A regular and vigilant medication regimenis critical or resistance will develop because HIV strains mutate and canbecome resistant to HAART relatively easily.The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been the mainstayof AIDS therapy in recent years. These drugs interfere with viral reversetranscriptase, which impairs HIV s ability to tum its ribonucleic acid into DNA for insertion into the host cell.Antiretroviral therapy typically begins when the patient s CD4 T-cellcount drops to less than 500/u L or when the patient develops anopportunistic infection. Most clinicians recommend starting the patient on acombination of these drugs in an attempt to gain the maximum benefit and toinhibit the production of resistant mutant strains of HIV. The drugcombinations and dosages are then altered, depending on the patient sresponse.Increasingly, physicians are basing changes in therapy on the patient sviral load rather than on the CD4 T-cell count. Because the CD4 count isinfluenced by the total WBC count, changes in the CD4 count may havenothing to do with changes in the patient s HIV status. Many physicianssuggest that patients on antiretroviral therapy have their viral load checkedevery 3 months.The increasing use of protease inhibitors (PIs) has greatly increased thelife expectancy of patients with AIDS. These drugs block the enzymeprotease, which HIV needs to produce virions, the viral particles that spreadthe virus to other cells. The use of PIs dramatically reduces viral load sometimes to undetectable levels while producing a _ correspondingincrease in the CD4 T-cell count and, because they act at a different site than",13,113
964,"nucleoside analogues, the PIs don t produce additional adverse effects whenadded to a patient s regimen.Antiviral therapy includes the use of multiple combined drug therapies thatsuppress the replication of the HIV virus in the body. Entry/fusion inhibitorsare a Class of antiviral drugs that work by blocking HIV entry into cells andcan be used as part of the HAART regimen. In addition, integrase inhibitors,which stop the protein integrase from allowing HIV to place its geneticmaterial into an infected cell, may also be added to the treatment regimen.After antiviral therapy is initiated, treatment should be aggressive. Initially,HAART, consisting of a triple-drug therapy regimen a PI and two non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is recommended. In addition tothese primary treatments, anti-infectives are used to combat opportunisticinfections (some are used prophylactically to help patients resistopportunistic infections), and antineoplastic drugs are used to fightassociated neoplasms. Supportive treatments help maintain nutritional statusand relieve pain and other distressing physical and psychological symptoms.Special Considerations Advise healthcare workers and the public to use precautions in allsituations that risk exposure to blood, body fluids, and secretions.Diligently practicing standard precautions can prevent the inadvertenttransmission of AIDS and other infectious diseases that are transmitted bysimilar routes. (See Preventing AIDS transmission.)PREVENTIONPREVENTING AIDS TRANSMISSIONHealthcare workers and the public are advised to use precautions inall situations that risk exposure to blood, body fluids, and secretions.These precautions include: Educate the patient and family, sexual partners, and friends aboutdisease transmission and prevention of extending the disease toothers. Inform the patient not to donate blood, blood products, organs,tissue, or sperm. Ifthe patient uses I. V. drugs, caution them not to share needles.",10,102
965,"Inform the patient that high-risk sexual practices for AIDStransmission are those that exchange body fluids, such as vaginalor anal intercourse without a condom. Discuss safer sexual practices, such as hugging, petting, mutualmasturbation, and protected sexual intercourse. Abstaining is themost protective method of not transmitting the disease. Advise female patients of childbearing age to avoid pregnancy.Explain that an infant may become infected before birth, duringdelivery, or during breastfeeding.Recognize that a diagnosis of AIDS is profoundly distressing because ofthe disease s social impact and discouraging prognosis. The patient maylose his or her job and financial security as well as the support of familyand friends. Do your best to help the patient cope with an altered bodyimage, the emotional burden of serious illness, and the threat of death, andencourage and assist the patient in leaming about AIDS societies andsupport programs.CHRONIC MUCOCUTANEOUS CANDIDIASISChronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is a form of candidiasis (moniliasis) thatusually develops during the first year of life but occasionally occurs as lateas the 20s, affecting males and females. In some patients, an autoimmuneresponse affecting the endocrine system may induce variousendocrinopathies.Despite chronic candidiasis, these patients seldom die of systemicinfection. Instead, they usually die of hepatic or endocrine failure. Theprognosis for chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis depends on the severity ofthe associated endocrinopathy. Patients with associated endocrinopathyseldom live beyond their 30s.Causes and Incidence No characteristic immunologic defects have been identified in this infection,but many patients have a diminished response to various antigens or to Candida alone. In some patients, anergy may result from deficient migrationinhibition factor, a mediator normally produced by lymphocytes.",11,96
966,"Candida species infections are the most common causes of fungalinfections in patients who are immunocompromised. About three of everyfour females have at least one bout of vulvovaginal candidiasis during theirlifetimes. In individuals who are HIV-positive, more than 90 experienceoropharyngeal candidiasis and 10 have at least one episode of esophagealcandidiasis.Pathophysiology Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is characterized by repeated infectionwith Candida albicans that may result from an inherited defect in cell-mediated (T-cell) immunity. (Humoral B-cell immunity remains intact andprovides a normal antibody response to C. albicans.)Complications Addison disease Nephrotoxicity Hypoparathyroidism Hypocalcemia with seizures Diabetes mellitus Pemicious anemia Corticotropin deficiency Ovarian failure Signs and Symptoms Chronic candidal infections can affect the skin, mucous membranes, nails,and vagina, usually causing large, circular lesions. These infections seldomproduce systemic symptoms but in late stages may be associated withrecurrent respiratory tract infections. Other associated conditions includesevere viral infections that may precede the onset of endocrinopathy and,sometimes, hepatitis. Involvement of the mouth, nose, and palate may causespeech and eating difficulties.Symptoms of endocrinopathy are peculiar to the organ involved. Tetanyand hypocalcemia are most common and are associated withhypoparathyroidism. Addison disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, andpemicious anemia are also connected with chronic mucocutaneous",11,69
967,"candidiasis. Psychiatric disorders are likely because of disfigurement andmultiple endocrine aberrations.Diagnosis Laboratory findings usually show a normal circulating T-cell count, althoughit may be decreased. Skin tests don t usually show delayed hypersensitivityto Candida, even during the infectious stage. Migration inhibiting factor thatindicates the presence of activated T cells may not respond to Candida.Nonimmunologic abnormalities resulting from endocrinopathy may includehypocalcemia, abnormal hepatic function studies, hyperglycemia, irondeficiency, and abnormal vitamin B,, absorption (pemicious anemia).Diagnosis must rule out other immunodeficiency disorders associated withchronic Candida infection, especially DGS, ataxia-telangiectasia, and severecombined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), all of which produce severeimmunologic defects. After diagnosis, the patient needs evaluation ofadrenal, pituitary, thyroid, gonadal, pancreatic, and parathyroid function aswell as careful follow-up. The disease is progressive, and most patientseventually develop endocrinopathy.Treatment Treatment aims to control infection but isn t always successful. Topicalantifungal agents, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin, are useful.They may be prescribed as mouthwashes or troches (lozenges) for 5 to 10days.Systemic infections may not be fatal, but they re serious enough to warrantvigorous treatment. Ketoconazole and fluconazole have had some positiveeffect. Oral or I.M. iron replacement may also be necessary. Treatment mayalso include plastic surgery of the lesions, when possible, and counseling tohelp patients cope with their disfigurement.Special Considerations Teach the patient about the disease s progressive manifestations andemphasize the importance of seeing an endocrinologist for regular checkups.CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME",11,81
968,"Sometimes called chronic Epstein-Barr virus or myalgicencephalomyelitis, chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome istypically marked by debilitating fatigue, neurologic abnormalities, andpersistent symptoms that suggest chronic mononucleosis. It commonly occursin adults younger than age 45, primarily in women.Causes and Incidence The cause of CFS is unknown, but researchers suspect that it may be found inhuman herpes virus-6 or in other herpesviruses, enteroviruses, orretroviruses. Recent studies have shown that inflammation of nervous systempathways, acting as an immune or autoimmune response, may play a role aswell. CFS may also be associated with a reaction to viral illness that scomplicated by dysfunctional immune response and by other factors that mayinclude gender, age, genetic disposition, prior illness, stress, andenvironment.Of the 4 million people with CFS in the United States, less than 20 havebeen diagnosed.Pathophysiology The immune system is upregulated in CFS and the levels of antibodies tovarious previously encountered antigens are increased. Although increasedtiters do not indicate a causal relationship in CFS, the titers are nonethelessuseful as laboratory clues, which, when taken together, are common inpatients with CFS.Signs and Symptoms CFS has specific symptoms and signs, based on the exclusion of otherpossible causes. Its characteristic symptom is prolonged, oftenoverwhelming fatigue that s commonly associated with a varying complex ofother symptoms that are similar to those of many infections, includingmyalgia and cephalgia. It may develop within a few hours and can last for 6months or more. Fatigue isn t relieved by rest and is severe enough to restrict ADLs by at least 50 .Diagnosis",8,88
969,"Because the cause and nature of CFS are still unknown, no single testunequivocally confirms its presence. Therefore, physicians base thisdiagnosis on the patient s history and the CDC criteria. (See Criteria fordiagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome, page 440.) Because the CDC scriteria are admittedly a working concept that may not include all forms ofthis disease and are based on symptoms that can result from other diseases,diagnosis is difficult and uncertain.Criteria for diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome There is no blood test, brain scan, or other laboratory test to diagnosechronic fatigue syndrome (CFS); it s a diagnosis of exclusion. Followinga detailed patient history, review of medications, and laboratoryscreening tests, the physician should consider a diagnosis of CFS if twoof these criteria are met:1. Unexplained, persistent fatigue that s not due to ongoing exertion,isn t substantially relieved by rest, is of new onset (not lifelong),and results in a significant reduction in previous levels of activity.2. Four or more of the following symptoms are present for 6 months ormore: Impaired memory or concentration Postexertional malaise (extreme, prolonged exhaustion andsickness following physical or mental activity) Unrefreshing sleep Muscle pain Multijoint pain without swelling or redness Headaches of a new type or severity Sore throat that s frequent or recurring Tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes From: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronicfatigue syndrome. Retrieved April 19, 2011 from www.cdc.gov/cfs/cfsdiagnosis.htm.Treatment",9,71
970,"No treatment is known to cure CFS. Symptomatic treatment may involve theuse of medications to treat depression, anxiety, pain, discomfort, and fever.Hidden yeast infections may be present and should be treated. Endocrineabnormalities should be treated with replacement therapy when possible.Special Considerations Some patients may benefit from avoiding environmental irritants andcertain foods. Because patients with CFS may benefit from supportive contact withothers who share this disease, refer the patient to the CFS Association forinformation and to local support groups. Patients may also benefit frompsychological counseling.CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS DISEASEPatients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) may developgranulomatous inflammation, which leads to ischemic tissue damage.Causes and Incidence CGD is inherited as a recessive X-linked trait in 50 to 60 of affectedpatients. Males are more likely to be affected. The genetic defect may belinked to deficiency of the enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidephosphate oxidase. The inability of phagocytic cells to kill certain bacteriaand fungi leads to long-term and repeated infections.Pathophysiology Abnormal neutrophil metabolism impairs phagocytosis one of the body schief defense mechanisms resulting in increased susceptibility to low-virulent or nonpathogenic organisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis,E. coli, Aspergillus, and Nocardia. Phagocytes attracted to sites of infectioncan engulf these invading organisms but are unable to destroy them.Complications Bone damage and infections Pneumonia Lung damage Skin damage",10,86
971,"Chronic infections Signs and Symptoms Usually, the patient with CGD displays signs and symptoms associated withinfections of the skin, lymph nodes, lung, liver, and bone by age 2. Skininfection is characterized by small, well-localized areas of tendemess.Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp and axilla is also common. Lymph nodeinfection typically causes marked lymphadenopathy with draining lymphnodes and hepatosplenomegaly. Many patients develop liver abscess, whichmay be recurrent and multiple; abdominal tendemess, fever, anorexia, andnausea point to abscess formation. Other common infections includeosteomyelitis, which causes localized pain and fever, pneumonia, andgingivitis with severe periodontal disease.Diagnosis Clinical features of osteomyelitis, pneumonia, liver abscess, or chroniclymphadenopathy in a young child provide the first clues to CGD diagnosis.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS An important tool for confirming thisdiagnosis is the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test. A clear yellow dye,NBT is normally reduced by neutrophil metabolism, resulting in a colorchange from yellow to blue. Quantifying this color change estimates thedegree of neutrophil metabolism.Patients with CGD show impaired NBT reduction, indicating abnormalneutrophil metabolism. Another test measures the rate of intracellular killingby neutrophils; in CGD, killing is delayed or absent.Other laboratory values may support the diagnosis or help monitor diseaseactivity. Osteomyelitis typically causes elevated WBC count and ESR; bonescans help locate and size such infections. Recurrent liver or lung infectionmay eventually cause abnormal function studies. Cell-mediated and humoralimmunity are usually normal in CGD, although some patients havehypergammaglobulinemia.Treatment Early, aggressive treatment of infection is the chief goal in caring for apatient with CGD. Areas of suspected infection should be biopsied or",12,115
972,"cultured, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually started immediately without waiting for results of cultures. Confirmed abscesses may be drainedor surgically removed. Provide meticulous wound care after such treatment,including irrigation or packing.Many patients with CGD receive a combination of I.V. antibiotics, in manycases extended beyond the usual 10- to 14-day course. However, for fungalinfections with Aspergillus or Nocardia, treatment involves amphotericin Bin gradually increasing doses to achieve a maximum cumulative dose. During I.V. drug therapy, monitor vital signs frequently and rotate the IV. site every48 to 72 hours.To help treat antibiotic-resistant or life-threatening infection, or to helplocalize infection, the patient may receive granulocyte transfusions usuallyonce daily until the crisis has passed. During such transfusions, watch forfever and chills (these effects can sometimes be prevented by premedicationwith acetaminophen). Transfusions shouldn t be given for 6 hours before orafter amphotericin B to avoid severe pulmonary edema and, possibly,respiratory arrest.IFN-gamma may help reduce the number of severe infections. Bonemarrow transplantation is also promising,Special Considerations If prophylactic antibiotics are ordered, teach the patient and family how toadminister them properly and how to recognize adverse effects. Advisethem to promptly report any signs or symptoms of infection. Stress the importance of good nutrition and hygiene, especially meticulousskin and mouth care. During hospitalizations, encourage the patient to continue ADLs as muchas possible. Ifthe patient is a child, arrange for a tutor to help them keep up withschoolwork.SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASEIn SCID, both cell-mediated (T-cell) and humoral (B-cell) immunity aredeficient or absent, resulting in susceptibility to infection from all classes ofmicroorganisms during infancy. It s the most severe form of T-cell and B-celldeficiency.",16,97
973,"Pathophysiology At least three types of SCID exist: reticular dysgenesis, the most severe type,in which the hematopoietic stem cell fails to differentiate into lymphocytesand granulocytes; Swiss-type agammaglobulinemia, in which thehematopoietic stem cell fails to differentiate into lymphocytes alone; andenzyme deficiency, such as adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, in whichthe buildup of toxic products in the lymphoid tissue causes damage andsubsequent dysfunction.Causes and Incidence SCID is usually transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, although it maybe X-linked. In most cases, the genetic defect seems associated with failureof the stem cell to differentiate into T and B lymphocytes. Many moleculardefects, such as mutation of the kinase ZAP-70, can cause SCID. X-linked SCID is due to a mutation of a subunit of the IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7 receptors.Less commonly, it results from an enzyme deficiency.SCID affects more males than females. Its estimated incidence is inevery 100,000 to 500,000 births. Most untreated patients die from infectionwithin year of birth.Complications Infection Pneumonia Oral ulcers Failure to thrive Dermatitis Signs and Symptoms An extreme susceptibility to infection becomes obvious in the infant with SCID in the first months of life. The infant fails to thrive and developschronic otitis; sepsis; watery diarrhea (associated with Salmonella or E.coli); recurrent pulmonary infections (usually caused by Pseudomonas,cytomegalovirus, or P jiroveci formerly carinii ); persistent oralcandidiasis, sometimes with esophageal erosions; and possibly fatal viralinfections such as chickenpox.",7,87
974,"Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia usually strikes a _ severelyimmunodeficient infant in the first 3 to 5 weeks after birth. Onset is typicallyinsidious, with gradually worsening cough, low-grade fever, tachypnea, andrespiratory distress. Chest X-ray characteristically shows bilateralpulmonary infiltrates.Diagnosis Diagnosis is generally made clinically because most SCID infants sufferrecurrent overwhelming infections within 1 year of birth. Some infants arediagnosed after a severe reaction to vaccination.Defective humoral immunity is difficult to detect before age 5 months.Before that period, even normal infants have very small amounts of serum Ig M and Ig A. Normal Ig G levels merely reflect matemal Ig G.CONFIRMING DIAGNOSIS Severely diminished or absent T-cell numberand function, as well as lymph node biopsy showing absence oflymphocytes, can confirm the diagnosis of SCID.Treatment Treatment aims to restore the immune response and prevent infection.Histocompatible bone marrow transplantation is the only satisfactorytreatment available to correct immunodeficiency. Because bone marrow cellsmust be HLA and mixed leukocyte culture matched, the most common donorsare histocompatible siblings. However, because bone marrow transplant canproduce a potentially fatal graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction, newer methodsof bone marrow transplant that eliminate GVH reaction (such as lectinseparation and the use of monoclonal antibodies) are being evaluated.Fetal thymus and liver transplants have achieved limited success. Immuneglobulin administration may also play a role in treatment. Some SCID infantshave received long-term protection by being isolated in a completely sterileenvironment. However, this approach isn t effective if the infant already hashad recurring infections.The standard treatment for ADA deficiency is enzyme therapy. The enzymeused, PEG-ADA, is 90 effective in children. Gene therapy is also beingused to treat ADA deficiency.Special Considerations",12,93
975,"Patient care is primarily preventive and supportive. Constantly monitor the infant for early signs of infection. If infectiondevelops, provide prompt and aggressive drug therapy as ordered. Watchfor adverse effects of any medications given. Avoid vaccinations and give only irradiated blood products ifatransfusion is ordered. Although SCID infants must remain in strict protective isolation, try toprovide a stimulating atmosphere to promote growth and development.Encourage the parents to visit their child often, to hold the child, and tobring toys that can be easily sterilized. If the parents can t visit, call themoften to report on the infant s condition. Explain all procedures,medications, and precautions to them. Maintain a normal day and nightroutine for the child and talk to the child as much as possible.Because the parents will have questions about the vulnerability of futureoffspring, refer them for genetic counseling. Arrange for psychological and spiritual support for the parents andsiblings to help them cope with the child s inevitable long-term illnessand early death.COMPLEMENT DEFICIENCIESComplement is a series of circulating enzymatic serum proteins with ninefunctional components, labeled C1 through C9. (The first four complementcomponents are numbered out of sequence, in order of their discovery C1,C4, C2, and C3 but the remaining five are numbered sequentially.)Complement deficiency or dysfunction may increase susceptibility toinfection and also seems related to certain autoimmune disorders.Theoretically, any complement component may be deficient or dysfunctional,and many such disorders are under investigation. Inherited or primarycomplement deficiencies are rare. The most common are C2, C4, C6, and C8deficiencies and C5 familial dysfunction. More common secondarycomplement abnormalities have been confirmed in patients with lupuserythematosus, in some with dermatomyositis, in some with scleroderma, andin a few with gonococcal and meningococcal infections. The prognosisvaries with the abnormality and the severity of associated diseases.Pathophysiology",16,99
976,"When Ig G or Ig M reacts with antigens as part of an immune response, itactivates Cl, which then combines with C4, initiating the classic complementpathway, or cascade. (An altemative complement pathway involves thedirect activation of C3 by the serum protein properdin, bypassing the initialcomponents Cl, C4, and C2 of the classic pathway.) Complement thencombines with the antigen-antibody complex and undergoes a sequence ofreactions that amplify the immune response against the antigen. This complexprocess, which is vital to normal immune response, is called complementfixation; it s necessary to promote chemotaxis, opsonization, phagocytosis,bacteriolysis, and anaphylaxis reactions.Causes and Incidence Primary complement deficiencies are inherited as autosomal recessive traits,except for deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor, which is autosomal dominant.Secondary deficiencies may follow complement-fixing (complement-consuming) immunologic reactions, such as drug-induced serum sickness,acute streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and acute active SLE.Inherited deficiency is rare in the general population, with an incidence of0.03 . C2 protein deficiency disorder occurs in in 10,000 persons.Complications Systemic lupus erythematosus Glomerulonephritis JRASigns and Symptoms Clinical effects vary with the specific deficiency. C2 and C3 deficienciesand C5 familial dysfunction increase susceptibility to bacterial infection(which may involve several body systems simultaneously). C2 and C4deficiencies are also associated with collagen vascular disease such as lupuserythematosus and with chronic renal failure. C5 dysfunction, a familialdefect in infants, causes failure to thrive, diarrhea, and seborrheic dermatitis.Cl esterase inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema) may cause periodicswelling in the face, hands, abdomen, or throat, with potentially fatallaryngeal edema.",8,89
977,"Diagnosis Diagnosis of a complement deficiency is difficult, requiring carefulinterpretation of both clinical features and laboratory results. Total serumcomplement level (CH50) is low in various complement deficiencies. Inaddition, specific assays may be done to confirm deficiency of specificcomplement components. For example, detection of complement componentsand Ig G by immunofluorescent examination of glomerular tissues inglomerulonephritis strongly suggests complement deficiency.Treatment Primary complement deficiencies have no known cure. Associated infection,collagen vascular disease, or renal disease requires prompt, appropriatetreatment. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma to provide replacement ofcomplement components is controversial because replacement therapydoesn t cure complement deficiencies, and any beneficial effects aretransient. A bone marrow transplant may be helpful but can cause apotentially fatal reaction (graft-versus-host-rejection). Anabolic steroidssuch as danazol and antifibrinolytic agents are often used to reduce acuteswelling in patients with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.Special Considerations Teach the patient (or his/her family, if the patient is a child) theimportance of avoiding infection, how to recognize its early signs andsymptoms, and the need for prompt treatment if it occurs. After a bone marrow transplant, monitor the patient closely for signs of atransfusion reaction or GVH reaction.Meticulous patient care can speed recovery and prevent complications.For example, a patient with renal infection needs careful monitoring ofintake and output, tests for serum electrolytes and acid base balance, andobservation for signs of renal failure.When caring for a patient with hereditary angioedema, be prepared foremergency management of laryngeal edema; keep airway equipment onhand.SELECTED REFERENCES",9,78
